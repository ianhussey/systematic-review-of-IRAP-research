	abstract = {Experiment 1 aimed to establish “fearful” and “pleasant” functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar' Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.},

The IAT and IRAP tasks involved responding under time pressure on a computerized task, with response latency as the dependent variable. The IAT required participants to categorize positively or negatively valenced words with stimuli associated with either Work or Holidays. The IRAP required that participants confirm or deny that Work and Holidays are similar or opposite to positively and negatively valenced words. Participants also completed an explicit measure consisting of a Likert-based questionnaire. In both Experiments, citizens of the United States of America produced performances on the IAT and IRAP that indicated more negative attitudes to work and more positive attitudes to holidays than both Canadian and Irish citizens. Responses on the explicit measures did not accord with this overall pattern of group differences. The results support the use of the IRAP as a measure of implicit attitudes and furthermore the findings appear to be generally consistent with a recent large-scale survey of attitudes to work across 23 countries.

	abstract = {This study examined implicit and explicit anxiety in individuals with epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) and explored whether these constructs were related to experiential avoidance and seizure frequency. Based on recent psychological models of PNESs, it was hypothesized that nonepileptic seizures would be associated with implicit and explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance. Explicit anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; implicit anxiety was measured by an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; and experiential avoidance was measured with the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire. Although both groups with epilepsy and PNESs scored similarly on implicit measures of anxiety, significant implicit–explicit anxiety discrepancies were only identified in patients with PNESs (p {\textless} .001). In the group with PNESs (but not in the group with epilepsy), explicit anxiety correlated with experiential avoidance (r = .63, p {\textless} .01) and frequency of seizures (r = .67, p {\textless} .01); implicit anxiety correlated with frequency of seizures only (r = .56, p {\textless} .01). Our findings demonstrate the role of implicit anxiety in PNESs and provide additional support for the contribution of explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance to this disorder.

A difference-score was calculated by subtracting consistent from inconsistent response latencies. The inconsistent trials and the difference-score provided measures of relational flexibility. Results showed that faster responding on the IRAP and smaller difference- scores predicted higher IQ, These findings suggest that relational flexibility is an important component of intelligence and might therefore be targeted in educational settings.

However, the mechanisms by which specific intervention strategies exert their effect have not been clearly identified. Objective: This study investigated the prospective relationships between two psychological processes, an attentional bias toward cocaine stimuli and beliefs about the consequences of cocaine use, and treatment outcome. Method: Twenty-five cocaine-dependent participants enrolled in a 6-month outpatient treatment program that included voucher incentives for abstinence. All participants were asked to complete two implicit assessment procedures, a Drug Stroop protocol and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as well as explicit measures of cocaine craving and the consequences of cocaine use, prior to beginning treatment. Pearson’s correlation coefficients tested the prospective relationships between treatment outcome and the implicit and explicit assessments. Results: Stronger implicit beliefs about the positive effects of cocaine use prior to treatment were associated with poorer treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was in place. Further, an attentional bias for cocaine-related stimuli was associated with better treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was removed. No association between cocaine use beliefs and treatment outcome was found when beliefs were measured with self-report instruments. Conclusions and scientific significance: These findings highlight the potential utility of performance-based measures for delineating the psychological mechanisms associated with variation in response to treatment for drug dependence.

Finally, participants completed the BAT using a live common house spider. Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. No significant differences between the two verbal-rehearsal conditions emerged on the self-report measures, the IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated in the reduce-fear condition. When considered in the context of the results previously reported by Leech et al., the differential pattern of correlations observed in the current study suggest that the verbal rehearsal task impacted upon a behavior–behavior relation that may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the acceptance and commitment therapy literature.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: There is increasing evidence that disgust responding occurs at both a primary and secondary level in the form of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. The unique contributions of anxiety and disgust need to be established if disgust is to be implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary objective of the current study was to develop two separate implicit measures of disgust propensity and sensitivity and to explicate the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in avoidance behavior and OC tendencies. Methods: The current study (N = 33 undergraduate students) utilized a measure of implicit cognition, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to independently analyze disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. In addition, a series of behavioral approach tasks (BAT) and questionnaires measuring general disgust, obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies and general psychopathology were implemented to validate the implicit measures. Results: Disgust sensitivity predicted avoidance behavior on the BATs independent of disgust propensity and anxiety, while disgust propensity did not. Both disgust propensity and sensitivity predicted self-reported OC tendencies and individually predicted obsessing and washing concerns, respectively. Limitations: Our findings are based on a non-clinical student sample and further research is required for generalization to OCD. Conclusions: The implicit measures appeared to be measuring two separate constructs and had differential relationships with behavior and OC tendencies. Overall, the results support current theories relating to pathological disgust and OCD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Self-esteem (SE), or one's sense of competence and worth, is reduced in many mental and physical disorders. Low SE is associated with perceived stigma and disability and poor treatment outcomes. The present study examined implicit and explicit SE (automatic and deliberate views about the self) in people with epilepsy and people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). Discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE have been found to correlate with psychological distress in disorders often associated with PNESs but are relatively unexplored in PNESs. We hypothesized that, compared with epilepsy, PNESs would be associated with lower self-reported SE and greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE. Methods: Thirty adults with PNESs, 25 adults with epilepsy, and 31 controls without a history of seizures were asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale as a measure of explicit SE and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit SE. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire—15 (a somatic symptom inventory) were also administered. Results: We found significant group differences in explicit (p {\textless} 0.001) but not implicit SE. Patients with PNESs reported lower SE than the other groups. No group differences were found in implicit SE. Implicit–explicit SE discrepancies were larger in the group with PNESs than in the other groups (p {\textless} 0.001). Higher frequency of PNESs (but not epileptic seizures) was associated with lower explicit SE (rs = −.83, p {\textless} 0.01) and greater SE discrepancies (i.e., lower explicit relative to implicit SE; rs = .65, p {\textless} 0.01). These relationships remained significant when controlling for anxiety and somatization. Conclusion: Patients with PNESs had lower explicit SE than those with epilepsy or healthy controls. In keeping with our expectations, there were greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE among patients with PNESs than in the other groups. Our results, including the strong relationship between PNES frequency, anxiety, and explicit–implicit SE discrepancies, support the interpretation that PNESs serve to reduce cognitive dissonance, perhaps protecting patients' implicit SE.

	abstract = {It has been proposed that a crucial link between cognitive (i.e., self-schemas) and biological vulnerability is prefrontal control. This is because decreased control leads to impaired ability to inhibit ruminative thinking after the activation of negative self-schemas. However, current evidence is mainly correlational. In the current experimental study we tested whether the effect of neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on self-esteem is mediated by momentary ruminative self-referential thinking (MRST) after the induction of negative self-schemas by criticism. We used a single, sham-controlled crossover session of anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC (cathode over the right supraorbital region) in healthy female individuals. After receiving tDCS/sham stimulation, we measured MRST and exposed the participants to critical audio scripts, followed by another MRST measurement. Subsequently, all participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures to implicitly measure actual and ideal self-esteem. Our behavioral data indicated a significant decrease in MRST after real but not sham tDCS. Moreover, although there was no immediate effect of tDCS on implicit self-esteem, an indirect effect was found through double mediation, with the difference in MRST from baseline to after stimulation and from baseline to after criticism as our two mediators. The larger the decrease of criticism induced MRST after real tDCS, the higher the level of actual self-esteem. Our results show that tDCS can influence cognitive processes such as rumination, and subsequently self-esteem, but only after the activation of negative self-schemas. Rumination and negative self-esteem characterize different forms of psychopathology, and these data expand our knowledge of the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling these self-referential processes, and the mechanisms of action of tDCS.

	abstract = {Pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) are often considered the most challenging group to manage within mainstream education. The challenges perceived by teachers may be due, in part, to negative attitudes towards this cohort of pupils, which may exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and impact negatively upon direct interactions with pupils. The current study comprised a combination of implicit (i.e. the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, IRAP) and explicit (The Opinions Relative to Mainstreaming Scale, ORMS) technologies to assess the attitudes of teachers (N = 25) and teachers in training (N = 20) towards pupils with EBD. When these attitudes proved to be negative (relative to typically developing pupils), the utility of a combined behaviour intervention (BI) and stress-management intervention (SMI), in conjunction with a series of pre and post measures, was examined. The IRAP results for teachers indicated that the SMI enhanced their implicit positivity towards pupils with EBD (EBD PUPIL) to a considerable extent (0.025-0.175), and this was greater than the impact recorded with the BI. The teachers in training showed implicit negativity towards EBD PUPIL (0.13) and this decreased, albeit marginally, at post-BI (0.05) and post-SMI (0.06). Significant differences were recorded in teachers’ general attitudes towards inclusion (p {\textless} 0.001) and efficacy (p {\textless} 0.008). Significant effects were recorded for teachers in training in relation to their attitudes towards having a child with EBD and having a previously excluded child with EBD in their classrooms (all ps {\textless} 0.001). For this latter group, reductions were also recorded in their levels of depression, anxiety and stress (p {\textless} 0.001) and there was an increase in their psychological flexibility (p {\textless} 0.001). The current results indicate that a range of positive implicit and explicit outcomes was associated with the current BI and SMI package in terms of fostering more effective inclusion of pupils with EBD in mainstream education.

	abstract = {The freshman year of college has been identified as a time when some students experience large changes in their eating behaviors, body image, and weight. One factor that is predictive of changes in these variables is internalization of the thin ideal (i.e., the degree to which an individual has accepted societal values of thinness and applies these values to herself). However, given the limitation of self-report and previous research demonstrating the additional predictive validity implicit measurement provides, it may be important to develop an implicit paradigm for assessing internalization of the thin ideal. The Implicit Association Test is the most common implicit measurement technique. However this test is associational in nature, which reflects only one aspect of human cognition. The current study evaluates a newly-created implicit measure of internalization of the thin ideal that utilizes the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In particular, the study investigates concurrent and prospective associations between internalization of the thin ideal and disordered eating, body image dissatisfaction, and weight in a group of women at the beginning and end of their freshman year in college. Results of the study indicate that weight, disordered eating and body image dissatisfaction increased during the freshman year, and that these were predicted by implicit internalization of the thin ideal at the beginning of the year. Moreover, the new implicit measure was predictive above and beyond any predictive ability of the explicit measure. Results indicate that the thin ideal IRAP can successfully predict changes in many variables of interest at the freshman year of college, and suggest it may be a beneficial screening tool to assess at-risk freshman. This study also highlights the need for additional implicit measures in the realm of body image and disordered eating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Providers of SUD treatment services have been shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures. However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD treatment and therapist training.

Method: Seventy-six participants were assigned randomly to complete an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in either a pub or lecture context. The IRAP exposed participants to pictorial cues that depicted an alcoholic beverage in the foreground of a pub (alcohol-congruent stimuli) or university lecture theater (alcohol-incongruent stimuli), and participants were required to match both positive and negative alcohol-related outcome expectancies to these stimuli. Corresponding to a 4 × 2 design, IRAP trial types were included in the analysis as repeated-measure variables, whereas testing environment was input as a between-participants variable. Results: Participants more readily endorsed that drinking alcohol was related to positive expectancies when responding to alcohol-congruent stimuli, and this was strengthened when participants completed the task in a pub. Moreover, they more readily confirmed that alcohol was related to negative expectancies when responding to alcohol-incongruent stimuli. Conclusions: These findings suggest that alcohol-related cues and environmental contexts may be a significant driver of positive alcohol-related cognitions, which may have implications for the design of interventions. They emphasize further the importance of examining implicit cognitions in ecologically valid testing contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study sought to extend this research by assessing both relative and individual implicit biases using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). An explicit measure screened for men with androphilic (n = 16) or gynephilic (n = 16) orientations on the dimensions of 'sexual attraction,' 'sexual behavior,' 'sexual fantasies,' 'hetero/gay lifestyle,' and 'self identification.' The IRAP involved responding 'True' or 'False' to pictures of nude males and females as either attractive or unattractive. Participants were required to respond in a manner consistent with their reported sexual orientation for half of the IRAP’s test blocks and inconsistent for the other half. Response latencies were recorded and analyzed. The IRAP revealed a non-orthogonal pattern of biases across the two groups and had an excellent ability to predict sexual orientation with areas under the curves of 1.0 for the relative bias score and .94 and .95 for the bias scores for the male and female pictures, respectively. Correlations between the IRAP and explicit measures of sexual orientation were consistently high. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially valuable tool in the study of sexual preferences.

To address this issue, the present study assessed the impact of a defusion intervention on behavior, as measured by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Undergraduates high in spider fear (N=65) were randomly assigned to one of two interventions targeting phobic thoughts of spiders: a defusion intervention or a thought distraction intervention.

Participants completed the IRAP and rating scales of believability and distress of target thoughts pre- and post-intervention. Consistent with expectation, defusion produced significantly greater pre- to post-intervention reductions in IRAP effects and thought believability relative to comparison conditions. The practical and scientific implications of the present findings, suggesting that defused behavior is broad and flexible relative to narrow and inflexible, are discussed.

The current research aimed to determine whether a new assessment methodology, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), could provide further evidence for Ward and Keenan’s (1999) children as sexual beings implicit theory. The results indicated that the IRAP was significantly more effective at identifying core implicit differences between sexual offenders against children and nonoffenders than a cognitive distortion questionnaire. Furthermore, although both groups demonstrated an overall response bias towards adults as sexual and children as nonsexual, this bias was significantly impaired in the sexual offender group. The findings are discussed in relation to previous implicit theory research and recommendations for the development of implicit methodologies are made.

	abstract = {We examined whether implicit measures of actual and ideal body image can be used to predict body dissatisfaction in young female adults. Participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied with their body. Adding further weight to the idea that both IRAP measures captured different underlying constructs, we also observed that they correlated differently with body mass index, explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate relational information relative to implicit measures that allow for an assessment of associative relations only.

Two IRAPs were employed, one that assessed relational responses specific to death and life with respect to self, and a second that assessed relational responses specific to evaluations of death and life. The IAT replicated previous results found in normative populations. The IRAPs indicated 'prolife' biases, as expected. However, they also failed to demonstrate the presence of strong 'antideath' biases, and in one case a specific 'death–positive' bias was found. The results observed on the explicit measures did not readily explain the absent or 'prodeath' effects observed on the IRAPs.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Suicidal behaviour has proved to be difficult to predict, due in part to the particular limitations of introspection within suicidality. In an effort to overcome this, recent research has demonstrated the utility of indirect measures of 'implicit' attitudes within the study of suicidality. However, research to date has focused predominantly on implicit self-evaluations and self-death associations. No work has examined implicit evaluations of death, despite the theoretical importance of such evaluations; 'fearlessness of death' is central to both the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicide.. Methods: Twenty-three psychiatric patients with current suicidal ideation and twenty-five normative university students completed two versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that targeted evaluations of death. One task specified personal death (i.e., was self-focused) and the other targeted death in the abstract. Results: Self-focused evaluations of death reliably distinguished between the two groups, correctly classifying 74\% of cases, but evaluations of death in the abstract did not. The suicidal group produced specific biases indicating a rejection of the negativity of death. Results are consistent with the definition of suicidality as involving a self-focused wish to die.. Limitations: For ethical reason, suicidal behaviours were not assessed in the normative group. Groups were therefore not mutually exclusive. This may have decreased the specificity of the IRAP. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is associated with an implicit 'fearlessness of death'. The utility of implicit death-evaluations should therefore be considered alongside self-evaluations and self-death associations in the future..

This study aimed to replicate previous research on the impact of social exclusion on paranoia and self-esteem in a non-clinical sample and to extend this work by examining the effect of exclusion on self-esteem at the ‘implicit’ level. Methods: Non-clinical participants (N = 85) were randomly allocated to the Inclusion or Exclusion condition of a virtual ball-toss game (‘Cyberball’). They completed self-report measures of state paranoia and self-esteem, and two implicit measures of self—Association Task (IAT) and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) –prior to and after exposure to Cyberball. Results: Social exclusion increased state paranoia. This effect was moderated by distress associated with trait paranoia. Exclusion was also associated with decreased self-reported self-esteem, as well as reduced implicit self-esteem on the IAT. Changes in self-reported self-esteem were associated with state paranoia at post-Cyberball. The IRAP indicated that reductions in implicit self-esteem may be due to increases in ‘Me-Negative’ and ‘Others-Positive’ biases (rather than reductions in ‘Me-Positive’ bias). Limitations: The current study involved a non-clinical sample and so findings cannot be generalized to clinical paranoia. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous evidence that paranoia is associated with negative self-evaluations, whereas positive self-evaluations can persist in paranoia. They also provide support for the suggestion that investigations of self-esteem in paranoia should extend beyond global self-esteem and might benefit from a distinction between positive and negative components.

Following this training, two other stimuli were related as same (C1) and opposite (C2), respectively, to B1. Participants were tested for derived relations and then the transformation of functions from the happy pictures to B1, B2, C1, and C2 was verified using a semantic differential and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from the semantic differential happy/sad scale, taken together with IRAP, indicated the transformation of stimulus functions: Arbitrary stimuli acquired a meaning similar or opposite to the happy faces, according to the trained or derived relations of sameness or opposition.

A number of behavioral tasks have demonstrated potential in assessing EA, including a limited number of studies using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). IRAP studies of EA to date have involved relatively small samples, limited consideration of dependent variables, and/or stimulus configurations that addressed a conceptually narrow aspect of EA. The current study describes the initial piloting of an IRAP designed to assess implicit repertoires regarding EA and acceptance in response to anxiety-relevant and positive emotional words. A variety of conceptually relevant self-report measures were administered along with the EA IRAP to a sample of college undergraduates. Dependent variables included average latencies for each block type as well as D-scores for each trial type of the IRAP. Evidence for convergent validity was revealed by correlations between the IRAP block-type latencies and a self-report measure of defusion, while unexpected divergent relations were obtained between self-reports and IRAP D-scores. Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated. We discuss alternative approaches to stimulus selection (including response options), increased efforts to reduce attrition, and utilization of clinical samples.

On this path, we created a taxonomy of some critical features of voice hearing based on the existing literature (i.e., perceived normality of voices, appraisals of self and other people hearing voices, and fear of voices) as a focus of our experimental manipulations. It was our hope that our findings would add to the broad literature that has used explicit measures to study these phenomena, and that the use of an ‘implicit’ measure might assist toward a functional analytic understanding. Three pilot studies were conducted to assess the relations within which hearing voices participates in non-clinical voice hearers (i.e., individuals who hear voices but have no clinical diagnosis or distress) and compared to non-voice hearing control participants. The IRAP effects demonstrated both positive and negative relational responses across the three studies, and these effects varied according to explicit levels of delusional ideation. Furthermore, these IRAP effects also predicted explicit aspects of voice hearing and well-being. The current set of pilot studies demonstrate the utility and precision of the IRAP in this domain, and we propose that this type of experimental analysis may hold potential for future bottom-up functional analyses of voice hearing.

What little evidence that does exist suggests that automatic ingroup favoritism occurs alongside outgroup derogation. That is, Catholics and Protestants automatically evaluate ingroup members more positively than outgroup members, and also evaluate outgroup members more negatively than ingroup members. The current study addresses a methodological limitation in this early work and provides the first (non-relativistic) assessment of intergroup relational responding in a post-conflict setting using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP).

Because these results contrast with reports of widespread anti-fat attitudes, we aimed to clarify the nature of implicitly assessed evaluative body image responding by using stimuli more central to body image concerns. Seventy-five undergraduates (65.8 \% female) completed two IRAPs to examine three aims: (1) create IRAPs sensitive to histories of self-oriented anti-fat responding by using attractiveness-, fear-, and disgust-based stimulus relations; (2) evaluate responses to the different types of stimulus relations on the IRAPs separately and compare them to each other; and (3) examine correlations among IRAP responding and self-report measures of disgust, fear of fatness, and eating pathology. Results showed that participants demonstrated a self-thin-attractive relational bias. Unexpectedly, respondents also showed a self-fat-attractive relational bias and did not display self-fat-disgusting or self-fat-fear responding. IRAP effects for self-thin-attractive stimulus relations were larger than those for self-fat-attractive stimulus relations, suggesting the pro-self bias on these two trial types was larger when relating to oneself as being thin than when relating to oneself as being overweight. Correlations with self-report measures were nonsignificant. Results are discussed in the context of gaining a better understanding of implicit evaluative body image responding and contextual variables that influence IRAP responding.

Effects differed by trial type with 'Anxiety is bad' biases related to greater EA/anxiety, while 'calm is bad' biases related to lower EA/anxiety ('Good' biases were generally unrelated to outcomes). Implicit emotional judgments moderated the relationship of heart rate during the speech with speech time and willingness, such that increases in heart rate were only related to lower speech time and willingness among those high in implicit judgments.

One issue which emerges in the IRAP literature is that of participants failing to meet or uphold the necessary criteria to complete the IRAP, which results in their elimination from the study, which can be rather detrimental to results. The present study sought to delineate which factors may contribute to high attrition rates in IRAP research. Methodology: A previously used IRAP measuring spider fear was employed along with an n-back task and a series of questionnaires. Results: Results indicated that the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and focus attention on the task at hand was the best predictor of accuracy on the IRAP, irrespective of spider fear or current levels of anxiety. Conclusions: These results are promising for the use of the IRAP in clinically-relevant domains as they suggest that the psychopathology of participants does not affect performance on the IRAP.

Twenty-one participants, who were either graduate psychology students or practicing clinicians, completed the study. Results were consistent with previous research (Stockwell, Walker, \& Eshleman, The Psychological Record, 60(2), 307–324, 2010) in that responses on both the IRAP and Visual Analogue Scales showed an acceptance of mainstream sexual terms and unfavorable responding to BDSM terms; in contrast, Likert-scale questionnaire responses generally reflected favorable attitudes toward people who practice BDSM. IRAP scores were positively correlated with differences in smiling across the two interview conditions; that is, participants with anti-BDSM responding on the IRAP smiled significantly less while interviewing the BDSM-labeled confederate than when they interviewed the non-BDSM confederate. No other differences in interviewing behavior were observed or correlated with IRAP responding, suggesting that implicit attitudes may not be a reliable predictor of participant behavior during interviews of individuals labeled as practicing BDSM.

Yet when self-reported and automatic food preferences are assessed no such evaluative biases tend to emerge. We argue that situational (food deprivation) and methodological factors may explain why implicit measures often fail to discriminate between the food-evaluations of these two groups. Across three studies we manipulated the food deprivation state of clinically obese and normal-weight participants and then exposed them to an indirect procedure (IRAP) and self-report questionnaires. We found that automatic food-related cognition was moderated by a person's weight status and food deprivation state. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic and predictive value of implicit measures may be increased when (a) situational moderators are taken into consideration and (b) we pay greater attention to the different ways in which people automatically relate rather than simply categorize food stimuli.

Two implicit measures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared to assess attitudes towards women and science-based versus liberal arts college subjects. The results of the IAT suggested a tendency to associate ‘men’ rather than ‘women’ with ‘science’ for both male and female participants. The IRAP produced a more complex pattern of results, with females showing a tendency to pair men with science and with liberal arts, whereas the males showed a more neutral effect.

Groups of participants representing the low and high extremes of normative levels of depressive symptoms completed an IRAP before and after a sad mood–induction procedure.

After the sad mood induction, the 'normal' group showed no change, whereas the 'mild/moderate' depression group showed a significant decrease in the positivity of their emotional responses.

Twenty-four students with high social anxiety were randomly assigned to either cognitive defusion or control conditions. Participants completed a self-report measure of the believability of anxiety-related thoughts and the Anxiety IRAP before and after the interventions. Significant decreases in response latency on the IRAP for both consistent and inconsistent trials were found only in participants in the cognitive defusion condition. We suggest that narrow and inflexible responding (i.e., fusion) interferes with behavioral fluency in both consistent and inconsistent blocks of the implicit measure, and thus a defusion intervention reduced response latencies in both types of blocks. In the control condition, however, we found a reduction in response latencies only for the inconsistent blocks, due to practice that occurred in the absence of a floor effect. The self-report believability measure, which produced effects for both the defusion and control conditions, showed a larger effect size for the control condition. Our results suggest that future studies that seek to analyze the impact of defusion interventions, and the psychological processes involved, employ a range of measures such as the IRAP, with a particular focus on separating out the effects of the therapeutic intervention from possible practice effects.

The Crels similar and different served as response options for one IRAP with the RCIs true and false as response options for the other. The order in which the two different IRAPs were completed was counterbalanced across participants. Although the two types of response options yielded similar effects for the participants’ first exposures to the IRAPs, differences emerged during the second exposures. In addition, one of the four trial types from the IRAP appeared to be particularly sensitive to the Crel–RCI manipulation and the order in which the two types of IRAP blocks were presented (consistent-first versus inconsistent-first with natural verbal relations).

Participants also completed a Likert-type scale rating of the successfulness of attractive versus unattractive individuals. Statistical analyses were conducted with implicit and explicit data, and both indicated attractiveness bias for male and female participants. Directionality of implicit bias was analyzed via the IRAP 4 trial-type methodology to determine if bias was pro-attractive or anti-unattractive, or if it was evident in both directions; a statistically significant implicit proattractive and antiunattractive bias was shown for male and female participants, and the effect was greater for male participants.

	abstract = {Research on implicit attitudes to both male and female body size has produced evidence for the existence of an attitudinal bias in the form of preference for images of thinness over images of fatness. Specifically, studies that have employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) have shown that this bias is specifically attributable to a pro-slim attitude, rather than to an anti-fat one. It is not clear, however, if the same type of specific pro-slim bias will be found when attitudes are measured exclusively for female participants and only to female targets. The present study has employed the IRAP for the assessment of implicit attitudes towards fatness and slimness in a sample of 40 Spanish young female college students. The task required participants to respond relationally in alternating trial-blocks. In pro-slim/anti-fat blocks, they had to respond as if photos of underweight women were pleasant and photos of overweight women were unpleasant. In anti-fat/pro-slim blocks they had to respond according to the opposite pattern (overweight as pleasant and underweight as unpleasant). Additionally, participants had to produce explicit ratings of pleasantness for the same photos used in the IRAP (with a visual analogue scale: VAS), and answer measures of body dissatisfaction (the Body Shape Questionnaire: BSQ) and of eating disorders symptomatology (the Eating Attitudes Test: EAT-40). Results showed no evidence of implicit bias for body size (neither pro-slim nor anti-fat). Besides, no significant correlations were found between implicit and explicit measures. These results are consistent with prior evidence suggesting that women show less anti-fat prejudice than men, and with studies that find less anti-fat bias in Spanish population than in Anglo-Saxon population.

The current study examined the fakability of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an opportunity to examine split-half and test–retest reliability, an underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test–retest correlations; the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a significant test–retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but also the reliability of the measure.

Additionally, the research explored the extent to which responding on the IRAP correlated with standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Forty undergraduate and postgraduate students completed the study (20 individuals who were teaching on, attending, or who had attended a course in clinical behavior analysis and 20 students from different fields). The two groups (behavior therapists and nontherapists) completed the 2 IRAPs and the explicit measures. Overall, only 1 of the 2 IRAPs, the one that targeted feelings rather than outcomes, produced clear and significant differences between the behavior therapist and nontherapist groups. This result indicated that the diverging performances were specific to the stimuli that were presented in the IRAP rather than reflecting a generic between-group difference produced by the measure itself. Furthermore, both IRAPs predicted levels of self-reported psychopathology and self-compassion. A number of potential reasons why this pattern of results emerged using the 2 IRAPs and explicit measures with these 2 groups of participants are considered.

	abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is frequently employed over other measures of so-called implicit attitudes because it produces 4 independent and 'nonrelative' bias scores, thereby providing greater clarity around what drives an effect. Indeed, studies have sometimes emphasized the procedural separation of the four trial types by choosing to report only the results of a single, theoretically meaningful trial type. However, no research to date has examined the degree to which performance on a given trial type is impacted upon by other stimulus categories employed within the task. The current study examined the extent to which response biases toward 'women' are influenced by two different contrast categories: 'men' versus 'inanimate objects.' Results indicated that greater dehumanization of women was observed in the context of the latter relative to the former category. The findings highlight that the IRAP may be described as a nonrelative, but not acontextual, measure of brief and immediate relational responses.

Sixty university students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n = 19) mood induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS), materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP, shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad) compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were interpreted as an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’. Compared to the neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition demonstrated an increased bias towards ‘wanting less’ (p = .028). Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’ (rs 's ranging from−.455 to −.565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards wanting less (rs = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of ‘wanting more’ as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, to date, the field of psychology has struggled with the operationalization and assessment of binarist ideologies. The current article proposes a technical framework for the analysis of the gender binary and assesses the suitability of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of binarist gender beliefs. Forty-seven undergraduate students (26 female; Mage = 23.84) completed two IRAPs assessing the coordination of certain traits exclusively with women and others exclusively with men. Effects found on the IRAP were in the expected direction (i.e., relating men but not women with certain traits and women but not men with other traits). In addition, the traits ascribed to men within the IRAP were evaluated as more hirable by a large majority of participants (83\%) on an explicit preference task. The results therefore support the arguments that, first, gender traits do seem to be framed oppositionally in language and, second, this binary may underpin existing gender hierarchies in certain contexts.

A non-clinical sample (N=44 undergraduate students) completed an IRAP designed to assess appraisals of disgust-inducing pictorial stimuli based on the six belief domains at the implicit level. A series of self-report measures including the Obsessive-Beliefs Questionnaire, the Padua Inventory and the STAI were also implemented. Results indicated that a greater bias toward appraising disgusting stimuli as being negative was related to excessive responsibility and overestimation of threat along with perfectionism and intolerance for uncertainty.

Participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible across blocks of trials, with half of the blocks requiring responses that were deemed consistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Similar), and the other half inconsistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Opposite), with natural verbal relations. Shorter mean latencies were predicted for consistent than for inconsistent blocks. Two separate experiments supported this prediction. Event-related potentials, gathered during the second experiment, also proved to be sensitive to the IRAP, yielding more negative waveforms for inconsistent relative to consistent blocks of trials.

The IRAP assessed acceptance and avoidance of positively versus negatively valenced voices. All clinical participants completed the IRAP in terms of reaching the standard accuracy and latency criteria, thus demonstrating that a clinical (specifically psychosis) sample can complete content-specific IRAPs. Indeed, some procedural modifications were required and these have been outlined in the current manuscript. Preliminary results at both the group and individual levels appear to be in a meaningful direction for the psychosis sample, but not for the controls, which was consistent with our predictions.

In the original article Figure 2 on page 463 contained several mistakes. The correct figure is present in the erratum.] This preliminary study is the first to illustrate the conceptual rationale for, and methodological potential of, an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure designed to measure adolescents' smoking-related social identity preferences (SIP-IRAP). Even with a small sample comprising of eight adolescent smokers and eight nonsmokers, the IRAP data tentatively suggested that adolescent smokers have a tendency to relate the sample word 'Smoker' as 'Similar' to social acceptance words, but adolescent nonsmokers do not. The IRAP further distinguished smokers from nonsmokers by their tendency to relate 'Nonsmoker' as 'Similar' to social rejection words. The current study, in its presentation of an uncomplicated 'preparation-IRAP' for participants to rehearse before taking the SIP-IRAP, constitutes the earliest attempt to optimise participant performance on the original IRAP methodology. Given that the raison d' etre of the IRAP is to continually optimise experimental control over the measurement of verbal biases, we use the current study as a basis for explicating the chronology and evolving rationale for subsequent evolutions of the IRAP methodology currently entering the literature. A central aim of our account is to use IRAP first principles to collate and interpret such recent optimisations of the IRAP methodology, in order to recommend how best to use the IRAP in future investigations probing the verbal networks of adolescent smokers. The current preliminary study particularly emphasized the importance for optimising the precision of the IRAP, of using adjunctive participant preparation procedures. The current paper suggests how with optimizations, the IRAP is likely to provide additional predictive utility over self-report measures for adolescents, particularly when applied to relatively stigmatized or impulsive behaviours.

The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias, and event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from the EEG signals, provided a simultaneous measure of brain activity during these responses. Results revealed anti-Black and pro-White biased responding on the IRAP in terms of differential response latencies.

Study 1 presented adult smokers and nonsmokers with an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that assessed bias toward or against smokers and nonsmokers. Study 2 replicated this with adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Both studies also presented self-report measures. Both adult and adolescent smokers produced IRAP effects that indicated prosmoker biases; nonsmokers’ biases were relatively neutral. Trends in the data from Studies 1 and 2 led to a post hoc analysis of the nonsmoker data to investigate the potential impact of parental smoking status on nonsmokers’ biases. Both the IRAP and self-report measures data suggested that parental smoking status increased positivity in attitudes toward smokers among nonsmokers. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that the IRAP data in Study 1, but not Study 2, predicted smoking status above and beyond the self-report measures. The post hoc analyses showed a similar trend. The consistency of the findings with the only existing IRAP study of attitudes toward smokers, as well as with the broader literature, supports the view that response biases toward smokers may not change fundamentally from adolescence to adulthood, and that parental smoking status may having a moderating influence on these biases.

In addition, participants were asked to complete 2 explicit measures that were derived from the 2 IRAPs and another 2 explicit measures that targeted self-compassion and stress, anxiety, and depression. Results: The findings showed that the priming conditions affected the 2 IRAPs differentially.

To date, IRAP effects have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semiparametric measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement, \& Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models, in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.

	abstract = {How can implicit attitudes best be measured? The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), unlike the Implicit Association Test (IAT), claims to measure absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes. In the IRAP, participants make congruent (Fat Person-Active: false; Fat Person-Unhealthy: true) or incongruent (Fat Person-Active: true; Fat Person-Unhealthy: false) responses in different blocks of trials. IRAP experiments have reported positive or neutral implicit attitudes (e.g., neutral attitudes toward fat people) in cases in which negative attitudes are normally found on explicit or other implicit measures. It was hypothesized that these results might reflect a positive framing bias (PFB) that occurs when participants complete the IRAP. Implicit attitudes toward categories with varying prior associations (nonwords, social systems, flowers and insects, thin and fat people) were measured. Three conditions (standard, positive framing, and negative framing) were used to measure whether framing influenced estimates of implicit attitudes. It was found that IRAP scores were influenced by how the task was framed to the participants, that the framing effect was modulated by the strength of prior stimulus associations, and that a default PFB led to an overestimation of positive implicit attitudes when measured by the IRAP. Overall, the findings question the validity of the IRAP as a tool for the measurement of absolute implicit attitudes. A new tool (Simple Implicit Procedure:SIP) for measuring absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Method: Specifically, participants completed two IRAPs. One (the Feelings IRAP) targeted negative and positive feelings experienced while engaging in problematic versus nonproblematic behavior. The other (the Outcomes IRAP) targeted positive and negative outcomes believed to result from this behavior. Participants also completed standardized measures of psychological suffering and self-compassion as well as a questionnaire that targeted the behavior and reactions presented in the IRAPs. Results: While both IRAPs produced response biases that indicated that positive feelings and outcomes were related to nonproblematic behavior, neither produced clear evidence that negative feelings or outcomes were related to problematic behavior. Furthermore, specific response biases on the IRAP (i.e., a tendency to confirm that negative actions lead to negative outcomes) correlated with psychological suffering, particularly depression and stress.

The Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) and a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) using a spider moult were also employed. Negative response biases for spider fear and avoidance, but not for approach, were recorded. The bias for fear was significantly stronger than for avoidance and approach. Both IRAP’s failed to provide evidence for the predicative validity of the IRAP in terms of the BAT.

We attempted to replicate these findings with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Two experimental groups established two equivalence classes, each comprised of faces expressing either anger or happiness and nonsense words. The classes were established with SMTS for one group and with DMTS for the other. Then, nonsense words and the faces were respectively presented as 'attribute' and target stimuli in IRAP tasks. The DMTS group yielded the expected IRAP effect; the SMTS group yielded an IRAP effect only when the target was a happy face. It is discussed that DMTS can enhance transfer of 'semantic' functions between equivalent stimuli, supporting the idea that the relatedness of stimuli can vary as a function of experimental parameters.

Undergraduate students (N = 35) from a Spanish university completed a PT scale and a PT task (deictic relational task; DRT) that involved trials with different complexity (reversed and double reversed). Then, participants were asked to complete an IRAP to assess the level of complexity and flexibility involved in perspective-taking framing. Results showed that the IRAP captured the differences, on the one hand, in relational complexity when the participants were asked to respond saying Yes or No to their own perspective and, on the other hand, in relational flexibility when they were asked to change their own perspective. In addition, the IRAP effect correlated with high deictic ability as measured by the DRT (mainly in double-reversed trials). These findings suggest that the IRAP as designed in the present study seems to be a good indicator of complexity and flexibility in PT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Research has identified implicit gender-bias as a major barrier to women's progression in these fields. Previous research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) suggests that individuals studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for the development of interventions. If this relational response can become more normative it may influence attitudes and behavior towards women in STEM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

To our knowledge, the current study presents the first implicit measure of positive and negative future thinking. A sample of 71 volunteers (38 healthy; 33 with sub-clinical depression) completed both implicit and explicit measures of positive and negative future thinking. The findings indicate differences in the evaluation of both positive and negative future events between the two groups. However, group differences were more pronounced on the implicit measure.

To develop an answer to this central problem in the study of social movements, this paper investigates the possible role of cognitive mechanisms using the framework of System Justification Theory. It examines the explicit and implicit attitudes of London bankers and Occupy St. Paul's protesters towards capitalism and an alternative economic system (Resource Based Economy: RBE) using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure and questionnaires. As hypothesised, bankers were more likely than protesters to demonstrate positive attitudes towards conservative capitalistic worldviews/values on both explicit and implicit measures. Also as expected, protesters had more positive explicit attitudes towards the RBE than did bankers. However, implicit attitudes towards the RBE were neutral for both groups. The implicit capitalism measures correlated positively with the explicit Capitalism Semantic Differential Scales (SDS) and negatively with the RBE SDS. No correlations were found between the implicit RBE measures and any of the explicit SDSs. The central theoretical insight of this paper is that implicit attitudes play an important role in maintaining the status quo, and that cognitive factors may underpin the resilience of extant social, political and economic structures.},

The IRAP, however, allows for a deeper analysis of implicit attitudes with respect to both thin and fat in isolation, and it was found that medical students are, on average, actually both pro-thin and pro-fat, and on average are more pro-thin than pro-fat, as opposed to anti-fat. Additionally, it was found that medical students' implicit weight bias against fat/obese individuals improved over the first 2 years of medical training, and this improvement was specifically driven by improved implicit attitudes toward overweight and obese, while implicit attitudes toward thin remained constant over that time. The implications of more sensitive implicit bias assessment and specific changes in bias over time are discussed within the context of medical education curriculum development.},

Results across these studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together, these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence. Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low reliability of the IRAP.},

The current study utilized a race IRAP to assess evaluative biases among a balanced sample of Black and White undergraduates. The race IRAP was administered twice in a row in conjunction with a collection of self-report measures of racial attitudes. Results for reliability and convergent validity were generally supportive. Furthermore, observed biases appeared to reflect positive in-group biases rather than derogatory attitudes toward the out-group, an effect that would not be apparent with a similarly configured race IAT. Future research may benefit from consideration of the evaluative content of the IRAP as well as the racial demographics for both the participants and the experimenters.

	abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc explanation provided in a previously published article, the first experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved in producing IRAP effects—the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model—which is presented in the General Discussion.

In a move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological Record, 66, 243–252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to self was involved, only responding to others. The results from Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the read-aloud procedure.

One such variable is the type of rules that are employed when instructing the IRAP and the effect this might have on participants’ performances. In the current article, three experiments were used to assess the impact of three different types of rules or instructions on IRAP performance. The instructions varied in the degree to which they specified parts of the relational network being assessed by the IRAP. The findings showed that the type of rule presented to participants during an IRAP can have a dramatic effect on the strength and direction of the trial-type effects that are produced by the measure. Furthermore, the type of instructions employed appear to interact with the order in which the IRAP blocks are presented (history-consistent versus history-inconsistent). The findings indicate that the behavioural dynamics that occur when participants complete an IRAP require extensive and systematic experimental and conceptual analyses, and this work will likely have an important bearing on research seeking to investigate the predictive validity of the IRAP in applied research settings.

Despite these trends, however, self-report data may fall victim to a range of confounds including self-presentational biases. Recently, researchers have begun to assess implicit homo-negativity (i.e., attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women that are relatively unconscious and beyond volitional control) using a range of implicit measures. This chapter reviews the studies published to date in the area of implicit homo-negativity. The findings show that implicit attitudes as measured by the Implicit Association Test, the Sequential Priming Procedure and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure differ as a function of group status (i.e., heterosexual versus non-heterosexual). Specifically, implicit in-group "pride" and out-group "prejudice" were repeatedly produced by heterosexual participants. In contrast, non-heterosexuals were relatively egalitarian in their expression of implicit attitudes. Furthermore, in many of the studies, a divergence in performance between implicit and explicit attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women was observed.
