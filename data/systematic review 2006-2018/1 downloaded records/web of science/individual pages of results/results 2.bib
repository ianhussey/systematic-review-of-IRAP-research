Abstract = {{When derived stimulus relations are established, stimulus functions are
   altered. The present study aimed to verify whether arbitrary symbols
   related to meaningful stimuli (facial expressions of happiness) would
   have their meaning transformed in accordance with relations of sameness
   or opposition. The experiment started with training to establish the
   meaning of two contextual cues, one for sameness and one for opposition.
   Then, using these contextual cues, one pair of stimuli was related as
   same (B1) or opposite (B2) to six photos containing different people
   expressing happiness (A stimulus set, A1-A6). Following this training,
   two other stimuli were related as same (C1) and opposite (C2),
   respectively, to B1. Participants were tested for derived relations and
   then the transformation of functions from the happy pictures to B1, B2,
   C1, and C2 was verified using a semantic differential and the Implicit
   Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from the semantic
   differential happy/sad scale, taken together with IRAP, indicated the
   transformation of stimulus functions: Arbitrary stimuli acquired a
   meaning similar or opposite to the happy faces, according to the trained
   or derived relations of sameness or opposition.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to test the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) as a measure of self-forgiveness response biases related to
   emotional reactions and expected outcomes in everyday life. Unlike
   previous IRAPs, the stimuli were individualized in that they were based
   on ``problematic{''} and ``non-problematic{''} behaviors (e.g.,
   procrastination vs. keeping deadlines) that each participant reported at
   the beginning of the study.
   Specifically, participants completed two IRAPs. One (the Feelings IRAP)
   targeted negative and positive feelings experienced while engaging in
   problematic versus nonproblematic behavior. The other (the Outcomes
   IRAP) targeted positive and negative outcomes believed to result from
   this behavior. Participants also completed standardized measures of
   psychological suffering and self-compassion as well as a questionnaire
   that targeted the behavior and reactions presented in the IRAPs.
   While both IRAPs produced response biases that indicated that positive
   feelings and outcomes were related to nonproblematic behavior, neither
   produced clear evidence that negative feelings or outcomes were related
   to problematic behavior. Furthermore, specific response biases on the
   IRAP (i.e., a tendency to confirm that negative actions lead to negative
   outcomes) correlated with psychological suffering, particularly
   depression and stress.
   The findings suggest that individualized IRAPs, even those that target
   minor problematic behavior, may be predictive of psychological
   suffering.}},

Abstract = {{The current study explored implicit attitudes to life and death in a

   previous results found in normative populations. The IRAPs indicated

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{We examined whether implicit measures of actual and ideal body image can
   be used to predict body dissatisfaction in young female adults.
   Participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures
   (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning actual (e.g. I am
   thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I want to be thin). Body
   dissatisfaction was examined via self-report questionnaires and rating
   scales. As expected, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a
   differential influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the
   implicit belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited
   a high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who exhibited
   a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the implicit desire
   to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was stronger in participants
   who exhibited a high level of body dissatisfaction than in participants
   who were less dissatisfied with their body. Adding further weight to the
   idea that both IRAP measures captured different underlying constructs,
   we also observed that they correlated differently with body mass index,
   explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual and ideal
   body image. More generally, these findings underscore the advantage of
   using implicit measures that incorporate relational information relative
   to implicit measures that allow for an assessment of associative

   regulate cognitive memory in rats}},
Journal = {{NEUROPEPTIDES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ang IV is an endogenous peptide generated from the degradation of
   angiotensin II. Ang II was found to enhance learning and memory in CNS.
   PKMzeta was identified to be a fragment of PKCzeta (protein kinase
   Czeta). Its continuous activation was demonstrated to be correlated with
   the formation of memory in the hippocampus. Therefore, we investigated
   whether PKMzeta participates in the effects of Ang IV on memory. We
   first examined the effect of Ang IV on non-spatial memory/cognition in
   modified object recognition test in rats. Our data showed that Ang IV
   could increase the exploration time on novel object. The
   co-administration of ZIP (PKMzeta inhibitor) with Ang IV significantly
   blocked the effect by Ang IV. The effects of Ang IV on hippocampal LTP
   at the CA1 region were also evaluated. Ang IV significantly increased
   the amplitude and slope of the EPSPs, which was consistent with other
   reports. Surprisingly, instead of potentiating LTP,Ang IV caused a
   failed maintenance of LTP. Moreover, there was no quantitative change in
   PKMzeta induced by Ang IV and/or ZIP after behavioral experiments. Taken
   together, our data re-confirmed the finding of the positive effect of
   Ang IV to enhance memory/cognition. The increased strength of EPSPs with
   Ang IV could also have certain functional relevance. Since the
   behavioral results suggested the involvement of PKMzeta, we hypothesized
   that the enhancement of memory/cognition by Ang IV may rely on an
   increase in PKMzeta activity. Overall, the present study provided
   important advances in our understanding of the action of Ang IV in the
   hippocampus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A meta-analysis of criterion effects for the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in the clinical domain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{59-65}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) is a technique that is attracting a substantial body of research
   literature, particularly within the clinical domain.
   Method: In response, the present paper outlines a meta-analysis of
   clinically-focused IRAP effects (N = 494) to provide the first estimate
   of how well such effects validate against their respective criterion
   variables in general.
   Results: The meta-analysis incorporated clinically-focused IRAP effects
   from 15 studies yielding a large effect size, (r) over bar = .45, with a
   desirably narrow 95\% credibility interval (.23,.67). The funnel plot
   and subsequent sensitivity analyses indicated that this meta-effect was
   not subject to publication bias.
   Limitations: The present meta-effect is an estimate based upon an IRAP
   literature that is still evolving rapidly in the clinical domain, and so
   as per its accompanying credibility interval, all conclusions that
   follow are necessarily provisional even if bounded. Apart from the fact
   that the current meta-effect might be subject to inadvertent under-
   and/or over-estimations of the current literature, the present
   meta-effect might strengthen with further refinements of the IRAP.
   Conclusions: The current meta-effect provides the means to calculate
   what sample size would be required to achieve a statistical power of .80
   when testing the criterion validity of clinically-focused IRAP effects
   using a given parametric statistic. For example, first-order Pearson
   correlations would hypothetically require an N of 29-37 for such
   purposes depending upon how conservatively over-estimation of the
   present meta-effect is controlled for. Overall, the IRAP compares
   favourably with alternative implicit measures in clinical psychology.

Abstract = {{Within the hippocampus, the major somatostatin (SRIF) receptor subtype,
   the sst2A receptor, is localized at postsynaptic sites of the principal
   neurons where it modulates neuronal activity. Following agonist
   exposure, this receptor rapidly internalizes and recycles slowly through
   the trans-Golgi network. In epilepsy, a high and chronic release of
   somatostatin occurs, which provokes, in both rat and human tissue, a
   decrease in the density of this inhibitory receptor at the cell surface.
   The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is involved in vesicular
   trafficking and shares common regional distribution with the sst2A
   receptor. In addition, IRAP ligands display anticonvulsive properties.
   We therefore sought to assess by in vitro and in vivo experiments in
   hippocampal rat tissue whether IRAP ligands could regulate the
   trafficking of the sst2A receptor and, consequently, modulate limbic
   seizures. Using pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we
   demonstrate that IRAP ligands accelerate the recycling of the sst2A
   receptor that has internalized in neurons in vitro or in vivo. Most
   importantly, because IRAP ligands increase the density of this
   inhibitory receptor at the plasma membrane, they also potentiate the
   neuropeptide SRIF inhibitory effects on seizure activity. Our results
   further demonstrate that IRAP is a therapeutic target for the treatment
   of limbic seizures and possibly for other neurological conditions in
   which downregulation of G-protein-coupled receptors occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Why is it difficult to sustain collective action that challenges the

   problem in the study of social movements, this paper investigates the
   possible role of cognitive mechanisms using the framework of System
   Justification Theory. It examines the explicit and implicit attitudes of
   London bankers and Occupy St. Paul's protesters towards capitalism and
   an alternative economic system (Resource Based Economy: RBE) using the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure and questionnaires. As
   hypothesised, bankers were more likely than protesters to demonstrate
   positive attitudes towards conservative capitalistic worldviews/values
   on both explicit and implicit measures. Also as expected, protesters had
   more positive explicit attitudes towards the RBE than did bankers.
   However, implicit attitudes towards the RBE were neutral for both
   groups. The implicit capitalism measures correlated positively with the
   explicit Capitalism Semantic Differential Scales (SDS) and negatively
   with the RBE SDS. No correlations were found between the implicit RBE
   measures and any of the explicit SDSs. The central theoretical insight

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{109-117}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Self-esteem (SE), or one's sense of competence and worth, is
   reduced in many mental and physical disorders. Low SE is associated with
   perceived stigma and disability and poor treatment outcomes. The present
   study examined implicit and explicit SE (automatic and deliberate views
   about the self) in people with epilepsy and people with psychogenic
   nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). Discrepancies between implicit SE and
   explicit SE have been found to correlate with psychological distress in
   disorders often associated with PNESs but are relatively unexplored in
   PNESs. We hypothesized that, compared with epilepsy, PNESs would be
   associated with lower self-reported SE and greater discrepancies between
   implicit SE and explicit SE.
   Methods: Thirty adults with PNESs, 25 adults with epilepsy, and 31
   controls without a history of seizures were asked to complete the
   Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale as a measure of explicit SE and an Implicit
   Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit SE. The
   State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (a
   somatic symptom inventory) were also administered.
   Results: We found significant group differences in explicit (p < 0.001)
   but not implicit SE. Patients with PNESs reported lower SE than the
   other groups. No group differences were found in implicit SE.
   Implicit-explicit SE discrepancies were larger in the group with PNESs
   than in the other groups (p < 0.001). Higher frequency of PNESs (but not
   epileptic seizures) was associatedwith lower explicit SE (r(s) = -.83, p
   < 0.01) and greater SE discrepancies (i.e., lower explicit relative to
   implicit SE; r(s) = .65, p < 0.01). These relationships remained
   significant when controlling for anxiety and somatization.
   Conclusion: Patients with PNESs had lower explicit SE than those with
   epilepsy or healthy controls. In keeping with our expectations, there
   were greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE among
   patients with PNESs than in the other groups. Our results, including the
   strong relationship between PNES frequency, anxiety, and
   explicit-implicit SE discrepancies, support the interpretation that
   PNESs serve to reduce cognitive dissonance, perhaps protecting patients'
   implicit SE. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

   University of Nevada School of Medicine. That change required
   organizational and cultural changes in many different areas within the

   separate studies were conducted during this time of transition to
   evaluate the practices of major stakeholders within the organization:
   emerging leader interviews and a Faculty Forward((c)) survey for faculty
   and the application of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure for
   students. The results are depictive of ways by which behavioral systemic
   assessments can serve as important tools for guiding comprehensive and

Abstract = {{Relational Frame Theory (RFT) is a functional-analytic account of human

   premise of the theory is that language and cognition is composed of

   generate the development of a measure, known as the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure, which was designed initially to provide a metric
   of the strength or persistence of relational responding. Although the
   IRAP provides a measure of implicit attitudes, we argue that it is time
   to refocus on its original purpose: measuring the strength of relational
   framing. This refocusing has already started to generate a new
   conceptual framework, which potentially will lead to improved functional

Abstract = {{Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) utilizes cognitive defusion
   strategies to alter the function of unwanted, distressing thoughts so as
   to reduce their impact and foster greater psychological flexibility.
   Though defusion is linked to several positive outcomes (e.g., reduced
   thought believability, improved pain tolerance), it remains unclear
   whether such effects are associated with the behavioral process of
   defusion itself; namely, behavior that is relatively broad and flexible
   compared with behavior that is narrow and inflexible. To address this
   issue, the present study assessed the impact of a defusion intervention
   on behavior, as measured by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP). Undergraduates high in spider fear (N = 65) were randomly
   assigned to one of two interventions targeting phobic thoughts of
   spiders: a defusion intervention or a thought distraction intervention.
   A control condition (reading an article) was used to evaluate the
   relative impact of both interventions. Participants completed the IRAP
   and rating scales of believability and distress of target thoughts pre-
   and post-intervention. Consistent with expectation, defusion produced
   significantly greater pre- to post-intervention reductions in IRAP
   effects and thought believability relative to comparison conditions. The
   practical and scientific implications of the present findings,
   suggesting that defused behavior is broad and flexible relative to
   narrow and inflexible, are discussed. (C) 2015 Association for

Abstract = {{Angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blockers that bind selectively AngII

   studied the ability of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan to cure or

   treatment) or adult (similar to 12 months at endpoint, 10 months
   treatment) human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We
   tested learning and memory with the Morris water maze, and evaluated
   neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling using
   {[}F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET and laser Doppler flowmetry
   responses to whisker stimulation. Cerebrovascular reactivity was
   assessed with on-line videomicroscopy. We measured protein levels of
   oxidative stress enzymes (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and NADPH
   oxidase subunit p67phox), and quantified soluble and deposited
   amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
   AngII receptors AT1 and AT2, angiotensin IV receptor AT4, and cortical
   cholinergic innervation. In aged APP mice, losartan did not improve
   learning but it consolidated memory acquisition and recall, and rescued
   neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling and cerebrovascular dilatory
   capacity. Losartan normalized cerebrovascular p67phox and SOD2 protein
   levels and up-regulated those of SOD1. Losartan attenuated astrogliosis,
   normalized AT1 and AT4 receptor levels, but failed to rescue the
   cholinergic deficit and the A beta pathology. Given preventively,
   losartan protected cognitive function, cerebrovascular reactivity, and
   AT4 receptor levels. Like in aged APP mice, these benefits occurred
   without a decrease in soluble A beta species or plaque load. We conclude
   that losartan exerts potent preventive and restorative effects on AD
   hallmarks, possibly by mitigating AT1-initiated oxidative stress and
   normalizing memory-related AT4 receptors. (C)2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This study examined implicit and explicit anxiety in individuals with

   anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; implicit
   anxiety was measured by an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; and
   experiential avoidance was measured with the Multidimensional
   Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire. Although both groups with epilepsy

Abstract = {{Oxytocin is a neuromodulator with antidepressant-like effects. In vitro,

   Oxytocin metabolites are known to exert strong central activities that

   investigate in vivo whether IRAP deletion modifies the
   antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice,
   IRAP wild-type (IRAP(+/+)) and knock-out (IRAP(-/-)) mice were injected
   subcutaneously with saline, oxytocin or oxytocin combined with
   angiotensin IV. One hour after injection, immobility was timed during a
   5 min forced swim that was preceded by an open field to study locomotor
   behaviour. Oxytocin induced antidepressant-like effects in male (0.25
   mg/kg oxytocin) and female (0.15 mg/kg oxytocin) C57Bl/6 mice subjected

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: There is increasing evidence that disgust
   responding occurs at both a primary and secondary level in the form of
   disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. The unique contributions of
   anxiety and disgust need to be established if disgust is to be
   implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders such as
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary objective of the
   current study was to develop two separate implicit measures of disgust
   propensity and sensitivity and to explicate the role of implicit disgust
   propensity and sensitivity in avoidance behavior and OC tendencies.
   Methods: The current study (N = 33 undergraduate students) utilized a
   measure of implicit cognition, the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure (IRAP), to independently analyze disgust propensity and
   disgust sensitivity. In addition, a series of behavioral approach tasks
   (BAT) and questionnaires measuring general disgust, obsessive-compulsive
   (OC) tendencies and general psychopathology were implemented to validate
   the implicit measures.
   Results: Disgust sensitivity predicted avoidance behavior on the BATs
   independent of disgust propensity and anxiety: while disgust propensity
   did not. Both disgust propensity and sensitivity predicted self-reported
   OC tendencies and individually predicted obsessing and washing concerns,
   respectively.
   Limitations: Our findings are based on a non-clinical student sample and
   further research is required for generalization to OCD.
   Conclusions: The implicit measures appeared to be measuring two separate
   constructs and had differential relationships with behavior and OC
   tendencies. Overall, the results support current theories relating to
   pathological disgust and OCD. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin IV (Ang IV) provides

   IRAP knockout mice and wild-type controls were subjected to 2 h of

   The cerebral infarct volume was significantly reduced in the IRAP

   improvement in neurological performance at 24 h post-ischemia. An
   increase in compensatory cerebral blood flow during MCAo was observed in

Abstract = {{Background: Psychosocial interventions for substance dependence have

   use, and treatment outcome. Method: Twenty-five cocaine-dependent
   participants enrolled in a 6-month outpatient treatment program that

Abstract = {{The peptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) influences seizure susceptibility in
   rat and mouse models. Indeed, Ang IV has been shown to protect rats from
   limbic seizures in the focal pilocarpine model. Moreover, both
   anticonvulsive and antiepileptogenic effects of Ang IV have been
   reported in the acute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and kindling model of
   generalized seizures in mice. It has been hypothesized that the latter
   effects on seizures could be established via a modulatory effect on
   dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia or via an indirect interaction
   between Ang IV and adenosine A1 receptors. However, a possible role for
   insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), the high affinity binding site
   for Ang IV, has not been studied yet. To unequivocally unravel the
   involvement of IRAP in generalized seizure generation, we investigated
   the susceptibility of male IRAP wild-type (IRAP(+/+)) and knock-out
   (IRAP(-/-)) mice to PTZ-induced seizures. Challenging these mice
   intravenously with PTZ resulted in significantly increased thresholds
   for myoclonic twitch and generalized clonic seizures with loss of

Abstract = {{The freshman year of college has been identified as a time when some
   students experience large changes in their eating behaviors, body image,
   and weight. One factor that is predictive of changes in these variables
   is internalization of the thin ideal (i.e., the degree to which an
   individual has accepted societal values of thinness and applies these
   values to herself). However, given the limitation of self-report and
   previous research demonstrating the additional predictive validity
   implicit measurement provides, it may be important to develop an
   implicit paradigm for assessing internalization of the thin ideal. The
   Implicit Association Test is the most common implicit measurement
   technique. However this test is associational in nature, which reflects
   only one aspect of human cognition. The current study evaluates a
   newly-created implicit measure of internalization of the thin ideal that
   utilizes the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In
   particular, the study investigates concurrent and prospective
   associations between internalization of the thin ideal and disordered
   eating, body image dissatisfaction, and weight in a group of women at
   the beginning and end of their freshman year in college. Results of the
   study indicate that weight, disordered eating and body image
   dissatisfaction increased during the freshman year, and that these were
   predicted by implicit internalization of the thin ideal at the beginning
   of the year. Moreover, the new implicit measure was predictive above and
   beyond any predictive ability of the explicit measure. Results indicate
   that the thin ideal IRAP can successfully predict changes in many
   variables of interest at the freshman year of college, and suggest it
   may be a beneficial screening tool to assess at-risk freshman. This
   study also highlights the need for additional implicit measures in the
   realm of body image and disordered eating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   with a particular emphasis on the fundamental structure, measurement,
   and conceptual differences that have emerged between implicit and

   of the associative assumption in shaping our methodologies, research
   questions, and theories regarding implicit and explicit attitudes. In
   the third and final section, we offer two alternative and perhaps
   complementary nonassociative models for understanding implicit
   cognition. While the first model situates its explanation at the mental

Abstract = {{Inflammatory and ischemic processes contribute to the development of
   secondary brain damage after mechanical brain injury. Recent data
   suggest that thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs approved for
   the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, effectively
   reduces inflammation and brain lesion by stimulation of the peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). The present study
   investigates the influence of the TZD pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on
   inflammation and secondary brain damage after experimental traumatic
   brain injury (TBI). A controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was
   induced in male C57BL/6 mice to investigate following endpoints: (1)
   mRNA expression of PPAR-gamma and PPAR-gamma target genes (LPL, GLT1,
   and IRAP/Lnpep), and inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6,
   and iNOS), at 15 min, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-trauma; (2)
   contusion volume, neurological function, and gene expression after 24 h

   and 10 mg/kg IP at 30 min post-trauma); and (3) the role of PPAR-gamma
   to mediate protection was determined in animals treated with
   pioglitazone, the PPAR-gamma inhibitor T0070907, and a combination of
   both. Inflammatory marker genes, but not PPAR-gamma gene expression, was
   up-regulated after trauma. Pioglitazone reduced the histological damage
   and inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, rosiglitazone
   failed to suppress inflammation and histological damage. PPAR-gamma and
   PPAR-gamma target gene expression was not induced by pioglitazone and
   rosiglitazone. In line with these results, pioglitazone-mediated
   protection was not reversed by T0070907. The results indicate that the

Abstract = {{Individuals in the early stage of Parkinson's disease exhibit cognitive
   impairments as a result of hemisphere damage. The mesocortical dopamine
   system, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is implicated
   in cognitive functions and is characterized by an asymmetric
   organization. Oxytocinase activity (ox) is also asymmetrically
   distributed in the mPFC of normal rats and is involved in cognitive
   functions. OX was measured in the left and right mPFC of rats with left
   or right hemi-parkinsonism, induced by intrastriatal injections of
   6-hydroxydopamine, and compared with sham controls. These results
   demonstrated that the striking basal left predominance of OX observed in
   both the left and the right sham controls was radically disrupted in
   lesioned animals. The bilateral distribution in lesioned animals was
   altered differently depending on the injured hemisphere. These results
   may reflect changes in the enzyme substrates and consequently in the
   functions in which they are involved. These results may account, in
   part, for the cognitive abnormalities observed in hemi-parkinsonism. (C)

Abstract = {{The current research comprised two experiments that employed the

   participants completed the IRAP in either a public or private assessment
   situation. It was hypothesized that implicit pro-white stereotyping
   would decrease in the public context relative to the private context.
   The results, however, were not in accordance with this prediction. A
   second experiment was conducted to determine if requiring participants
   to respond in a public context but within a shorter time frame would
   impact significantly upon implicit stereotyping. The results showed that
   a reduction in response latency significantly increased ingroup
   stereotyping. The findings appear to be consistent with the relational

Abstract = {{The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a relatively new
   measure of implicit cognition that tests cognition as relational
   behavior instead of an associative activity and thus may provide a more

   Association Test (IAT). A small body of IRAP research provides tentative
   evidence for this measure's potential. The current study adds to this
   research by using the IRAP to assess for social biases for race,
   religion, gender, and obesity. Overall results show medium to large
   effect sizes for all conditions except obesity, as well as interesting
   trends at the trial-type level. These outcomes and possible future

Abstract = {{P>Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of angiotensin IV (Ang
   IV) or Leu-Val-Val-haemorphin 7 (LVV-H7) improves memory performance in
   normal rats and reverses memory deficits in rat models for cognitive
   impairment. These memory effects were believed to be mediated via the
   putative `AT4 receptor'. However, this binding site was identified as
   insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Correspondingly, Ang IV and
   LVV-H7 were characterised as IRAP inhibitors. This study investigates
   whether and how IRAP may be involved in the central effects of Ang IV
   and LVV-H7. We determined the effects of i.c.v. administration of Ang IV
   or LVV-H7 on hippocampal neurotransmitter levels using microdialysis in
   rats. We observed that Ang IV modulates hippocampal acetylcholine
   levels, whereas LVV-H7 does not. This discrepancy was reflected in the
   observation that Ang IV binds with micromolar affinity to the AT1
   receptor whereas no binding affinity was observed for LVV-H7.
   Correspondingly, we demonstrated that the AT1 receptor is involved in
   the effects of Ang IV on hippocampal neurotransmitter levels and on
   spatial working memory in a plus maze spontaneous alternation task.
   However, the AT1 receptor was not involved in the spatial memory
   facilitating effect of LVV-H7. Finally, we demonstrated that Ang IV did
   not diffuse to the hippocampus following i.c.v. injection, suggesting an
   extrahippocampal site of action. We propose that AT1 receptors are
   implicated in the neurochemical and cognitive effects of Ang IV, whereas
   LVV-H7 may mediate its effects via IRAP.}},
