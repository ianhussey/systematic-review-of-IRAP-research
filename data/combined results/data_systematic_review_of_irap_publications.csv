In some ways this categorization may perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination, such as women and men being viewed as suited for different educational and career pathways and family responsibilities. Much of the empirical literature and the gender theories that have been built from that literature are founded on self-report measures of gender perceptions. Self-reports of cognitive phenomena are vulnerable to social demand effects, a concern that has occasioned a comparatively small body of gender perception research with implicit measures. The current study explored implicit gender stereotypes among and between women and men with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, which can provide more specific assessments of biased attitudes than many comparable implicit measures. The results confirmed some previous findings, revealing stereotype-consistent attitudes and gender differences in the magnitude of those attitudes. Both of the genders measured provided response patterns indicating perceptions of women as emotional, gentle, and sensitive and of men as dominant, forceful, and logical. More specific and nuanced effects were also revealed, including a number of seemingly egalitarian effects and one stereotype-inconsistent bias for women when responding to the combination of women and the words dominant, forceful, and logical. These latter findings would be inaccessible with alternative implicit measures. These results may provide a foundation for a broader and deeper program of future research on the personal and social impact of gender stereotypes.","2018-03-01","2018-03-09 22:09:17","2023-01-10 18:57:56","2018-03-09 22:09:17","3-20","","1","35","","Gend.

Research has identified implicit gender-bias as a major barrier to women's progression in these fields. Previous research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) suggests that individuals studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for the development of interventions. If this relational response can become more normative it may influence attitudes and behavior towards women in STEM.

Then, participants were asked to complete an IRAP to assess the level of complexity and flexibility involved in perspective-taking framing. Results showed that the IRAP captured the differences, on the one hand, in relational complexity when the participants were asked to respond saying Yes or No to their own perspective and, on the other hand, in relational flexibility when they were asked to change their own perspective. In addition, the IRAP effect correlated with high deictic ability as measured by the DRT (mainly in double-reversed trials).

Two experimental groups established two equivalence classes, each comprised of faces expressing either anger or happiness and nonsense words.

The DMTS group yielded the expected IRAP effect; the SMTS group yielded an IRAP effect only when the target was a happy face.

The Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) and a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) using a spider moult were also employed. Negative response biases for spider fear and avoidance, but not for approach, were recorded. The bias for fear was significantly stronger than for avoidance and approach. Both IRAP’s failed to provide evidence for the predicative validity of the IRAP in terms of the BAT. Experiment 2 was a partial replication of Experiment 1 but using a live house spider instead of a moult for the BAT. A similar pattern of results was obtained across the two IRAPs, but one specific trial-type (Spider-Approach) predicted approach responses on the BAT. The research, thus, replicated a previously published study by Nicholson and Barnes-Holmes (2012), thus supporting the predictive validity of the IRAP but at a level of precision not provided in the earlier study.

Unlike previous IRAPs, the stimuli were individualized in that they were based on 'problematic' and 'non-problematic' behaviors (e.g., procrastination vs. keeping deadlines) that each participant reported at the beginning of the study. Method: Specifically, participants completed two IRAPs. One (the Feelings IRAP) targeted negative and positive feelings experienced while engaging in problematic versus nonproblematic behavior. The other (the Outcomes IRAP) targeted positive and negative outcomes believed to result from this behavior. Participants also completed standardized measures of psychological suffering and self-compassion as well as a questionnaire that targeted the behavior and reactions presented in the IRAPs. Results: While both IRAPs produced response biases that indicated that positive feelings and outcomes were related to nonproblematic behavior, neither produced clear evidence that negative feelings or outcomes were related to problematic behavior. Furthermore, specific response biases on the IRAP (i.e., a tendency to confirm that negative actions lead to negative outcomes) correlated with psychological suffering, particularly depression and stress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that individualized IRAPs, even those that target minor problematic behavior, may be predictive of psychological suffering.

The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), unlike the Implicit Association Test (IAT), claims to measure absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes. In the IRAP, participants make congruent (Fat Person-Active: false; Fat Person-Unhealthy: true) or incongruent (Fat Person-Active: true; Fat Person-Unhealthy: false) responses in different blocks of trials. IRAP experiments have reported positive or neutral implicit attitudes (e.g., neutral attitudes toward fat people) in cases in which negative attitudes are normally found on explicit or other implicit measures. It was hypothesized that these results might reflect a positive framing bias (PFB) that occurs when participants complete the IRAP. Implicit attitudes toward categories with varying prior associations (nonwords, social systems, flowers and insects, thin and fat people) were measured. Three conditions (standard, positive framing, and negative framing) were used to measure whether framing influenced estimates of implicit attitudes. It was found that IRAP scores were influenced by how the task was framed to the participants, that the framing effect was modulated by the strength of prior stimulus associations, and that a default PFB led to an overestimation of positive implicit attitudes when measured by the IRAP. Overall, the findings question the validity of the IRAP as a tool for the measurement of absolute implicit attitudes. A new tool (Simple Implicit Procedure:SIP) for measuring absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes is proposed.

In a move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological Record, 66, 243–252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to self was involved, only responding to others. The results from Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the read-aloud procedure.

Across IRAP trials, each child's own name (e.g., MARY) was juxtaposed with a common name of the opposite gender (e.g., PETER), and presented in conjunction with three positive or three negative words and the two relational terms SIMILAR and OPPOSITE. The results indicated that both groups of children showed an implicit pro-self bias in trial-types denoted as Self-Positive and Self-Negative.

The current study uses the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc explanation provided in a previously published article, the first experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved in producing IRAP effects—the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model—which is presented in the General Discussion.

To date, IRAP effects have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semiparametric measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement, & Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models, in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.

Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Method: Eighty-one undergraduates were assigned in 2 groups, where they were presented with different conditions, positive and negative priming, in which participants had to recall in writing three experiences of failing or succeeding; participants then completed 2 IRAPs, 1 targeting feelings and the other targeting outcomes as related to failing and succeeding behaviors. In addition, participants were asked to complete 2 explicit measures that were derived from the 2 IRAPs and another 2 explicit measures that targeted self-compassion and stress, anxiety, and depression. Results: The findings showed that the priming conditions affected the 2 IRAPs differentially. Furthermore, the IRAP that targeted feelings predicted level of self-reported psychopathology but only for participants in the positive priming condition.

Study 1 presented adult smokers and nonsmokers with an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that assessed bias toward or against smokers and nonsmokers. Study 2 replicated this with adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Both studies also presented self-report measures. Both adult and adolescent smokers produced IRAP effects that indicated prosmoker biases; nonsmokers’ biases were relatively neutral. Trends in the data from Studies 1 and 2 led to a post hoc analysis of the nonsmoker data to investigate the potential impact of parental smoking status on nonsmokers’ biases. Both the IRAP and self-report measures data suggested that parental smoking status increased positivity in attitudes toward smokers among nonsmokers. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that the IRAP data in Study 1, but not Study 2, predicted smoking status above and beyond the self-report measures. The post hoc analyses showed a similar trend. The consistency of the findings with the only existing IRAP study of attitudes toward smokers, as well as with the broader literature, supports the view that response biases toward smokers may not change fundamentally from adolescence to adulthood, and that parental smoking status may having a moderating influence on these biases.

The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias, and event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from the EEG signals, provided a simultaneous measure of brain activity during these responses. Results revealed anti-Black and pro-White biased responding on the IRAP in terms of differential response latencies.

In the original article Figure 2 on page 463 contained several mistakes. The correct figure is present in the erratum.] This preliminary study is the first to illustrate the conceptual rationale for, and methodological potential of, an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure designed to measure adolescents' smoking-related social identity preferences (SIP-IRAP). Even with a small sample comprising of eight adolescent smokers and eight nonsmokers, the IRAP data tentatively suggested that adolescent smokers have a tendency to relate the sample word 'Smoker' as 'Similar' to social acceptance words, but adolescent nonsmokers do not. The IRAP further distinguished smokers from nonsmokers by their tendency to relate 'Nonsmoker' as 'Similar' to social rejection words. The current study, in its presentation of an uncomplicated 'preparation-IRAP' for participants to rehearse before taking the SIP-IRAP, constitutes the earliest attempt to optimise participant performance on the original IRAP methodology. Given that the raison d' etre of the IRAP is to continually optimise experimental control over the measurement of verbal biases, we use the current study as a basis for explicating the chronology and evolving rationale for subsequent evolutions of the IRAP methodology currently entering the literature. A central aim of our account is to use IRAP first principles to collate and interpret such recent optimisations of the IRAP methodology, in order to recommend how best to use the IRAP in future investigations probing the verbal networks of adolescent smokers. The current preliminary study particularly emphasized the importance for optimising the precision of the IRAP, of using adjunctive participant preparation procedures. The current paper suggests how with optimizations, the IRAP is likely to provide additional predictive utility over self-report measures for adolescents, particularly when applied to relatively stigmatized or impulsive behaviours.

The IRAP assessed acceptance and avoidance of positively versus negatively valenced voices. All clinical participants completed the IRAP in terms of reaching the standard accuracy and latency criteria, thus demonstrating that a clinical (specifically psychosis) sample can complete content-specific IRAPs. Indeed, some procedural modifications were required and these have been outlined in the current manuscript.

On each trial of the IRAP, participants were presented with I of 2 attribute stimuli ('Pleasant' or 'Unpleasant'), a positive (e.g., 'Love') or negative (e.g., 'Murder') target stimulus, and 2 relational terms, 'Similar' and 'Opposite,' as response options. Participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible across blocks of trials, with half of the blocks requiring responses that were deemed consistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Similar), and the other half inconsistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Opposite), with natural verbal relations. Shorter mean latencies were predicted for consistent than for inconsistent blocks. Two separate experiments supported this prediction. Event-related potentials, gathered during the second experiment, also proved to be sensitive to the IRAP, yielding more negative waveforms for inconsistent relative to consistent blocks of trials. A theoretical interpretation of the IRAP effect is offered, and important directions for future research are highlighted.

A non-clinical sample (N=44 undergraduate students) completed an IRAP designed to assess appraisals of disgust-inducing pictorial stimuli based on the six belief domains at the implicit level. A series of self-report measures including the Obsessive-Beliefs Questionnaire, the Padua Inventory and the STAI were also implemented. Results indicated that a greater bias toward appraising disgusting stimuli as being negative was related to excessive responsibility and overestimation of threat along with perfectionism and intolerance for uncertainty.

However, to date, the field of psychology has struggled with the operationalization and assessment of binarist ideologies. The current article proposes a technical framework for the analysis of the gender binary and assesses the suitability of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of binarist gender beliefs. Forty-seven undergraduate students (26 female; Mage = 23.84) completed two IRAPs assessing the coordination of certain traits exclusively with women and others exclusively with men. Effects found on the IRAP were in the expected direction (i.e., relating men but not women with certain traits and women but not men with other traits). In addition, the traits ascribed to men within the IRAP were evaluated as more hirable by a large majority of participants (83%) on an explicit preference task. The results therefore support the arguments that, first, gender traits do seem to be framed oppositionally in language and, second, this binary may underpin existing gender hierarchies in certain contexts.

Sixty university students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n = 19) mood induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS), materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP, shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad) compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were interpreted as an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’. Compared to the neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition demonstrated an increased bias towards ‘wanting less’ (p = .028). Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’ (rs 's ranging from−.455 to −.565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards wanting less (rs = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of ‘wanting more’ as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) perspective.

One such variable is the type of rules that are employed when instructing the IRAP and the effect this might have on participants’ performances. In the current article, three experiments were used to assess the impact of three different types of rules or instructions on IRAP performance. The instructions varied in the degree to which they specified parts of the relational network being assessed by the IRAP. The findings showed that the type of rule presented to participants during an IRAP can have a dramatic effect on the strength and direction of the trial-type effects that are produced by the measure. Furthermore, the type of instructions employed appear to interact with the order in which the IRAP blocks are presented (history-consistent versus history-inconsistent). The findings indicate that the behavioural dynamics that occur when participants complete an IRAP require extensive and systematic experimental and conceptual analyses, and this work will likely have an important bearing on research seeking to investigate the predictive validity of the IRAP in applied research settings.

Additionally, the research explored the extent to which responding on the IRAP correlated with standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Forty undergraduate and postgraduate students completed the study (20 individuals who were teaching on, attending, or who had attended a course in clinical behavior analysis and 20 students from different fields). The two groups (behavior therapists and nontherapists) completed the 2 IRAPs and the explicit measures. Overall, only 1 of the 2 IRAPs, the one that targeted feelings rather than outcomes, produced clear and significant differences between the behavior therapist and nontherapist groups. This result indicated that the diverging performances were specific to the stimuli that were presented in the IRAP rather than reflecting a generic between-group difference produced by the measure itself. Furthermore, both IRAPs predicted levels of self-reported psychopathology and self-compassion. A number of potential reasons why this pattern of results emerged using the 2 IRAPs and explicit measures with these 2 groups of participants are considered.

The current study examined the fakability of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an opportunity to examine split-half and test–retest reliability, an underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test–retest correlations; the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a significant test–retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but also the reliability of the measure. Future research might focus on methods of detecting and/or preventing faking of the procedure.

Specifically, studies that have employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) have shown that this bias is specifically attributable to a pro-slim attitude, rather than to an anti-fat one. It is not clear, however, if the same type of specific pro-slim bias will be found when attitudes are measured exclusively for female participants and only to female targets. The present study has employed the IRAP for the assessment of implicit attitudes towards fatness and slimness in a sample of 40 Spanish young female college students. The task required participants to respond relationally in alternating trial-blocks. In pro-slim/anti-fat blocks, they had to respond as if photos of underweight women were pleasant and photos of overweight women were unpleasant. In anti-fat/pro-slim blocks they had to respond according to the opposite pattern (overweight as pleasant and underweight as unpleasant). Additionally, participants had to produce explicit ratings of pleasantness for the same photos used in the IRAP (with a visual analogue scale: VAS), and answer measures of body dissatisfaction (the Body Shape Questionnaire: BSQ) and of eating disorders symptomatology (the Eating Attitudes Test: EAT-40). Results showed no evidence of implicit bias for body size (neither pro-slim nor anti-fat). Besides, no significant correlations were found between implicit and explicit measures. These results are consistent with prior evidence suggesting that women show less anti-fat prejudice than men, and with studies that find less anti-fat bias in Spanish population than in Anglo-Saxon population.

The current study used the IRAP to assess relational repertoires among college undergraduates in respect to images of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney presented in conjunction with positive and negative evaluative words.

The current study aimed to investigate whether the IRAP is an adequate measure to assess children’s implicit gender-based attitudes toward toys (dolls and toy cars). Although the software parameters used were taken from previous adult studies, children performed successfully in the task. The strongest IRAP effect found was for relations between dolls and girls (i.e., participants responded faster when relating dolls-girls-match than dolls-boys-match). Additionally, children’s response latencies were longer for pairings of dolls and boys than for pairings of toy cars and girls. These findings seem to confirm that the IRAP is sensitive to gender-stereotyped relations established in children and may be a useful tool in providing additional information to complement explicit measures in children’s attitudes.

Participants also completed a Likert-type scale rating of the successfulness of attractive versus unattractive individuals. Statistical analyses were conducted with implicit and explicit data, and both indicated attractiveness bias for male and female participants. Directionality of implicit bias was analyzed via the IRAP 4 trial-type methodology to determine if bias was pro-attractive or anti-unattractive, or if it was evident in both directions; a statistically significant implicit proattractive and antiunattractive bias was shown for male and female participants, and the effect was greater for male participants. Modest correlations were found between implicit and explicit data.

Although the two types of response options yielded similar effects for the participants’ first exposures to the IRAPs, differences emerged during the second exposures.

Twenty-four students with high social anxiety were randomly assigned to either cognitive defusion or control conditions. Participants completed a self-report measure of the believability of anxiety-related thoughts and the Anxiety IRAP before and after the interventions. Significant decreases in response latency on the IRAP for both consistent and inconsistent trials were found only in participants in the cognitive defusion condition. We suggest that narrow and inflexible responding (i.e., fusion) interferes with behavioral fluency in both consistent and inconsistent blocks of the implicit measure, and thus a defusion intervention reduced response latencies in both types of blocks. In the control condition, however, we found a reduction in response latencies only for the inconsistent blocks, due to practice that occurred in the absence of a floor effect. The self-report believability measure, which produced effects for both the defusion and control conditions, showed a larger effect size for the control condition. Our results suggest that future studies that seek to analyze the impact of defusion interventions, and the psychological processes involved, employ a range of measures such as the IRAP, with a particular focus on separating out the effects of the therapeutic intervention from possible practice effects.

The results indicated that the measure of implicit forgiveness diverged from an explicit measure designed to measure the same construct. The key finding was that participants tended to be more forgiving toward themselves than toward others at an implicit level, but on an explicit measure, participants rated their own failures as less acceptable than the failures of others.

Two implicit measures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared to assess attitudes towards women and science-based versus liberal arts college subjects. The results of the IAT suggested a tendency to associate ‘men’ rather than ‘women’ with ‘science’ for both male and female participants. The IRAP produced a more complex pattern of results, with females showing a tendency to pair men with science and with liberal arts, whereas the males showed a more neutral effect.

We argue that situational (food deprivation) and methodological factors may explain why implicit measures often fail to discriminate between the food-evaluations of these two groups. Across three studies we manipulated the food deprivation state of clinically obese and normal-weight participants and then exposed them to an indirect procedure (IRAP) and self-report questionnaires. We found that automatic food-related cognition was moderated by a person's weight status and food deprivation state. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic and predictive value of implicit measures may be increased when (a) situational moderators are taken into consideration and (b) we pay greater attention to the different ways in which people automatically relate rather than simply categorize food stimuli.

Twenty-one participants, who were either graduate psychology students or practicing clinicians, completed the study. Results were consistent with previous research (Stockwell, Walker, & Eshleman, The Psychological Record, 60(2), 307–324, 2010) in that responses on both the IRAP and Visual Analogue Scales showed an acceptance of mainstream sexual terms and unfavorable responding to BDSM terms; in contrast, Likert-scale questionnaire responses generally reflected favorable attitudes toward people who practice BDSM. IRAP scores were positively correlated with differences in smiling across the two interview conditions; that is, participants with anti-BDSM responding on the IRAP smiled significantly less while interviewing the BDSM-labeled confederate than when they interviewed the non-BDSM confederate. No other differences in interviewing behavior were observed or correlated with IRAP responding, suggesting that implicit attitudes may not be a reliable predictor of participant behavior during interviews of individuals labeled as practicing BDSM.

One issue which emerges in the IRAP literature is that of participants failing to meet or uphold the necessary criteria to complete the IRAP, which results in their elimination from the study, which can be rather detrimental to results. The present study sought to delineate which factors may contribute to high attrition rates in IRAP research. Methodology: A previously used IRAP measuring spider fear was employed along with an n-back task and a series of questionnaires. Results: Results indicated that the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and focus attention on the task at hand was the best predictor of accuracy on the IRAP, irrespective of spider fear or current levels of anxiety. Conclusions: These results are promising for the use of the IRAP in clinically-relevant domains as they suggest that the psychopathology of participants does not affect performance on the IRAP.

The IRAP required participants to respond quickly and accurately on a computer-based task. On some blocks of trials participants were required to respond in a pro-white and anti-black manner, whereas on other blocks responding in the opposite direction was required (anti-white/pro-black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias.

Because these results contrast with reports of widespread anti-fat attitudes, we aimed to clarify the nature of implicitly assessed evaluative body image responding by using stimuli more central to body image concerns. Seventy-five undergraduates (65.8 % female) completed two IRAPs to examine three aims: (1) create IRAPs sensitive to histories of self-oriented anti-fat responding by using attractiveness-, fear-, and disgust-based stimulus relations; (2) evaluate responses to the different types of stimulus relations on the IRAPs separately and compare them to each other; and (3) examine correlations among IRAP responding and self-report measures of disgust, fear of fatness, and eating pathology. Results showed that participants demonstrated a self-thin-attractive relational bias. Unexpectedly, respondents also showed a self-fat-attractive relational bias and did not display self-fat-disgusting or self-fat-fear responding. IRAP effects for self-thin-attractive stimulus relations were larger than those for self-fat-attractive stimulus relations, suggesting the pro-self bias on these two trial types was larger when relating to oneself as being thin than when relating to oneself as being overweight. Correlations with self-report measures were nonsignificant. Results are discussed in the context of gaining a better understanding of implicit evaluative body image responding and contextual variables that influence IRAP responding.

A number of behavioral tasks have demonstrated potential in assessing EA, including a limited number of studies using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). IRAP studies of EA to date have involved relatively small samples, limited consideration of dependent variables, and/or stimulus configurations that addressed a conceptually narrow aspect of EA. The current study describes the initial piloting of an IRAP designed to assess implicit repertoires regarding EA and acceptance in response to anxiety-relevant and positive emotional words. A variety of conceptually relevant self-report measures were administered along with the EA IRAP to a sample of college undergraduates. Dependent variables included average latencies for each block type as well as D-scores for each trial type of the IRAP. Evidence for convergent validity was revealed by correlations between the IRAP block-type latencies and a self-report measure of defusion, while unexpected divergent relations were obtained between self-reports and IRAP D-scores. Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated. We discuss alternative approaches to stimulus selection (including response options), increased efforts to reduce attrition, and utilization of clinical samples.

On this path, we created a taxonomy of some critical features of voice hearing based on the existing literature (i.e., perceived normality of voices, appraisals of self and other people hearing voices, and fear of voices) as a focus of our experimental manipulations. It was our hope that our findings would add to the broad literature that has used explicit measures to study these phenomena, and that the use of an ‘implicit’ measure might assist toward a functional analytic understanding. Three pilot studies were conducted to assess the relations within which hearing voices participates in non-clinical voice hearers (i.e., individuals who hear voices but have no clinical diagnosis or distress) and compared to non-voice hearing control participants. The IRAP effects demonstrated both positive and negative relational responses across the three studies, and these effects varied according to explicit levels of delusional ideation. Furthermore, these IRAP effects also predicted explicit aspects of voice hearing and well-being. The current set of pilot studies demonstrate the utility and precision of the IRAP in this domain, and we propose that this type of experimental analysis may hold potential for future bottom-up functional analyses of voice hearing.

In an effort to overcome this, recent research has demonstrated the utility of indirect measures of 'implicit' attitudes within the study of suicidality. However, research to date has focused predominantly on implicit self-evaluations and self-death associations. No work has examined implicit evaluations of death, despite the theoretical importance of such evaluations; 'fearlessness of death' is central to both the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicide.. Methods: Twenty-three psychiatric patients with current suicidal ideation and twenty-five normative university students completed two versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that targeted evaluations of death. One task specified personal death (i.e., was self-focused) and the other targeted death in the abstract. Results: Self-focused evaluations of death reliably distinguished between the two groups, correctly classifying 74% of cases, but evaluations of death in the abstract did not. The suicidal group produced specific biases indicating a rejection of the negativity of death. Results are consistent with the definition of suicidality as involving a self-focused wish to die.. Limitations: For ethical reason, suicidal behaviours were not assessed in the normative group. Groups were therefore not mutually exclusive. This may have decreased the specificity of the IRAP. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is associated with an implicit 'fearlessness of death'. The utility of implicit death-evaluations should therefore be considered alongside self-evaluations and self-death associations in the future..

Then, using these contextual cues, one pair of stimuli was related as same (B1) or opposite (B2) to six photos containing different people expressing happiness (A stimulus set, A1-A6). Following this training, two other stimuli were related as same (C1) and opposite (C2), respectively, to B1. Participants were tested for derived relations and then the transformation of functions from the happy pictures to B1, B2, C1, and C2 was verified using a semantic differential and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from the semantic differential happy/sad scale, taken together with IRAP, indicated the transformation of stimulus functions: Arbitrary stimuli acquired a meaning similar or opposite to the happy faces, according to the trained or derived relations of sameness or opposition.

This study aimed to replicate previous research on the impact of social exclusion on paranoia and self-esteem in a non-clinical sample and to extend this work by examining the effect of exclusion on self-esteem at the ‘implicit’ level. Methods: Non-clinical participants (N = 85) were randomly allocated to the Inclusion or Exclusion condition of a virtual ball-toss game (‘Cyberball’). They completed self-report measures of state paranoia and self-esteem, and two implicit measures of self—Association Task (IAT) and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) –prior to and after exposure to Cyberball. Results: Social exclusion increased state paranoia. This effect was moderated by distress associated with trait paranoia. Exclusion was also associated with decreased self-reported self-esteem, as well as reduced implicit self-esteem on the IAT. Changes in self-reported self-esteem were associated with state paranoia at post-Cyberball. The IRAP indicated that reductions in implicit self-esteem may be due to increases in ‘Me-Negative’ and ‘Others-Positive’ biases (rather than reductions in ‘Me-Positive’ bias). Limitations: The current study involved a non-clinical sample and so findings cannot be generalized to clinical paranoia. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous evidence that paranoia is associated with negative self-evaluations, whereas positive self-evaluations can persist in paranoia. They also provide support for the suggestion that investigations of self-esteem in paranoia should extend beyond global self-esteem and might benefit from a distinction between positive and negative components.

Participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied with their body. Adding further weight to the idea that both IRAP measures captured different underlying constructs, we also observed that they correlated differently with body mass index, explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate relational information relative to implicit measures that allow for an assessment of associative relations only.

Though defusion is linked to several positive outcomes (e.g., reduced thought believability, improved pain tolerance), it remains unclear whether such effects are associated with the behavioral process of defusion itself; namely, behavior that is relatively broad and flexible compared with behavior that is narrow and inflexible. To address this issue, the present study assessed the impact of a defusion intervention on behavior, as measured by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Undergraduates high in spider fear (N=65) were randomly assigned to one of two interventions targeting phobic thoughts of spiders: a defusion intervention or a thought distraction intervention. A control condition (reading an article) was used to evaluate the relative impact of both interventions. Participants completed the IRAP and rating scales of believability and distress of target thoughts pre- and post-intervention. Consistent with expectation, defusion produced significantly greater pre- to post-intervention reductions in IRAP effects and thought believability relative to comparison conditions. The practical and scientific implications of the present findings, suggesting that defused behavior is broad and flexible relative to narrow and inflexible, are discussed.

Method: Seventy-six participants were assigned randomly to complete an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in either a pub or lecture context. The IRAP exposed participants to pictorial cues that depicted an alcoholic beverage in the foreground of a pub (alcohol-congruent stimuli) or university lecture theater (alcohol-incongruent stimuli), and participants were required to match both positive and negative alcohol-related outcome expectancies to these stimuli. Corresponding to a 4 × 2 design, IRAP trial types were included in the analysis as repeated-measure variables, whereas testing environment was input as a between-participants variable. Results: Participants more readily endorsed that drinking alcohol was related to positive expectancies when responding to alcohol-congruent stimuli, and this was strengthened when participants completed the task in a pub. Moreover, they more readily confirmed that alcohol was related to negative expectancies when responding to alcohol-incongruent stimuli. Conclusions: These findings suggest that alcohol-related cues and environmental contexts may be a significant driver of positive alcohol-related cognitions, which may have implications for the design of interventions. They emphasize further the importance of examining implicit cognitions in ecologically valid testing contexts.

For both measures, relative bias scores were obtained, with no information on the separate response biases to each target gender. The present study sought to extend this research by assessing both relative and individual implicit biases using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). An explicit measure screened for men with androphilic (n = 16) or gynephilic (n = 16) orientations on the dimensions of 'sexual attraction,' 'sexual behavior,' 'sexual fantasies,' 'hetero/gay lifestyle,' and 'self identification.' The IRAP involved responding 'True' or 'False' to pictures of nude males and females as either attractive or unattractive. Participants were required to respond in a manner consistent with their reported sexual orientation for half of the IRAP’s test blocks and inconsistent for the other half. Response latencies were recorded and analyzed. The IRAP revealed a non-orthogonal pattern of biases across the two groups and had an excellent ability to predict sexual orientation with areas under the curves of 1.0 for the relative bias score and .94 and .95 for the bias scores for the male and female pictures, respectively. Correlations between the IRAP and explicit measures of sexual orientation were consistently high. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially valuable tool in the study of sexual preferences.

The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, a more recent measure based on response latency, was used to assess ISE. The analysis confirms the reports on NPI heterogeneity. Different relationships between the particular facets of narcissism and ESE/ISE were observed.

We measured implicit relational associations about actual and ideal self in low (N = 27) versus high dysphoric (N = 29) undergraduates. Our data revealed that dysphoric individuals have a higher ideal self-esteem, and lower actual self-esteem in comparison to healthy participants. The results underscore the need to go beyond simple associations and suggest that the use of individual–specific propositions could enhance our understanding of the implicit measurement of self-esteem.

Providers of SUD treatment services have been shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures. However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD treatment and therapist training.

One factor that is predictive of changes in these variables is internalization of the thin ideal (i.e., the degree to which an individual has accepted societal values of thinness and applies these values to herself). However, given the limitation of self-report and previous research demonstrating the additional predictive validity implicit measurement provides, it may be important to develop an implicit paradigm for assessing internalization of the thin ideal. The Implicit Association Test is the most common implicit measurement technique. However this test is associational in nature, which reflects only one aspect of human cognition. The current study evaluates a newly-created implicit measure of internalization of the thin ideal that utilizes the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In particular, the study investigates concurrent and prospective associations between internalization of the thin ideal and disordered eating, body image dissatisfaction, and weight in a group of women at the beginning and end of their freshman year in college. Results of the study indicate that weight, disordered eating and body image dissatisfaction increased during the freshman year, and that these were predicted by implicit internalization of the thin ideal at the beginning of the year. Moreover, the new implicit measure was predictive above and beyond any predictive ability of the explicit measure. Results indicate that the thin ideal IRAP can successfully predict changes in many variables of interest at the freshman year of college, and suggest it may be a beneficial screening tool to assess at-risk freshman. This study also highlights the need for additional implicit measures in the realm of body image and disordered eating.

The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a new behavior analytic measure of cognition that may provide a less relativistic and more specific measure of cognitive repertoires. The current study utilized a race IRAP to assess evaluative biases among a balanced sample of Black and White undergraduates. The race IRAP was administered twice in a row in conjunction with a collection of self-report measures of racial attitudes. Results for reliability and convergent validity were generally supportive. Furthermore, observed biases appeared to reflect positive in-group biases rather than derogatory attitudes toward the out-group, an effect that would not be apparent with a similarly configured race IAT. Future research may benefit from consideration of the evaluative content of the IRAP as well as the racial demographics for both the participants and the experimenters.

The challenges perceived by teachers may be due, in part, to negative attitudes towards this cohort of pupils, which may exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and impact negatively upon direct interactions with pupils. The current study comprised a combination of implicit (i.e. the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, IRAP) and explicit (The Opinions Relative to Mainstreaming Scale, ORMS) technologies to assess the attitudes of teachers (N = 25) and teachers in training (N = 20) towards pupils with EBD. When these attitudes proved to be negative (relative to typically developing pupils), the utility of a combined behaviour intervention (BI) and stress-management intervention (SMI), in conjunction with a series of pre and post measures, was examined. The IRAP results for teachers indicated that the SMI enhanced their implicit positivity towards pupils with EBD (EBD PUPIL) to a considerable extent (0.025-0.175), and this was greater than the impact recorded with the BI. The teachers in training showed implicit negativity towards EBD PUPIL (0.13) and this decreased, albeit marginally, at post-BI (0.05) and post-SMI (0.06). Significant differences were recorded in teachers’ general attitudes towards inclusion (p < 0.001) and efficacy (p < 0.008). Significant effects were recorded for teachers in training in relation to their attitudes towards having a child with EBD and having a previously excluded child with EBD in their classrooms (all ps < 0.001). For this latter group, reductions were also recorded in their levels of depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.001) and there was an increase in their psychological flexibility (p < 0.001). The current results indicate that a range of positive implicit and explicit outcomes was associated with the current BI and SMI package in terms of fostering more effective inclusion of pupils with EBD in mainstream education.

This is because decreased control leads to impaired ability to inhibit ruminative thinking after the activation of negative self-schemas. However, current evidence is mainly correlational. In the current experimental study we tested whether the effect of neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on self-esteem is mediated by momentary ruminative self-referential thinking (MRST) after the induction of negative self-schemas by criticism. We used a single, sham-controlled crossover session of anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC (cathode over the right supraorbital region) in healthy female individuals. After receiving tDCS/sham stimulation, we measured MRST and exposed the participants to critical audio scripts, followed by another MRST measurement. Subsequently, all participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures to implicitly measure actual and ideal self-esteem. Our behavioral data indicated a significant decrease in MRST after real but not sham tDCS. Moreover, although there was no immediate effect of tDCS on implicit self-esteem, an indirect effect was found through double mediation, with the difference in MRST from baseline to after stimulation and from baseline to after criticism as our two mediators. The larger the decrease of criticism induced MRST after real tDCS, the higher the level of actual self-esteem. Our results show that tDCS can influence cognitive processes such as rumination, and subsequently self-esteem, but only after the activation of negative self-schemas. Rumination and negative self-esteem characterize different forms of psychopathology, and these data expand our knowledge of the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling these self-referential processes, and the mechanisms of action of tDCS.

Low SE is associated with perceived stigma and disability and poor treatment outcomes. The present study examined implicit and explicit SE (automatic and deliberate views about the self) in people with epilepsy and people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). Discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE have been found to correlate with psychological distress in disorders often associated with PNESs but are relatively unexplored in PNESs. We hypothesized that, compared with epilepsy, PNESs would be associated with lower self-reported SE and greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE. Methods: Thirty adults with PNESs, 25 adults with epilepsy, and 31 controls without a history of seizures were asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale as a measure of explicit SE and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit SE. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire—15 (a somatic symptom inventory) were also administered. Results: We found significant group differences in explicit (p < 0.001) but not implicit SE. Patients with PNESs reported lower SE than the other groups. No group differences were found in implicit SE. Implicit–explicit SE discrepancies were larger in the group with PNESs than in the other groups (p < 0.001). Higher frequency of PNESs (but not epileptic seizures) was associated with lower explicit SE (rs = −.83, p < 0.01) and greater SE discrepancies (i.e., lower explicit relative to implicit SE; rs = .65, p < 0.01). These relationships remained significant when controlling for anxiety and somatization. Conclusion: Patients with PNESs had lower explicit SE than those with epilepsy or healthy controls. In keeping with our expectations, there were greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE among patients with PNESs than in the other groups. Our results, including the strong relationship between PNES frequency, anxiety, and explicit–implicit SE discrepancies, support the interpretation that PNESs serve to reduce cognitive dissonance, perhaps protecting patients' implicit SE.

The unique contributions of anxiety and disgust need to be established if disgust is to be implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary objective of the current study was to develop two separate implicit measures of disgust propensity and sensitivity and to explicate the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in avoidance behavior and OC tendencies. Methods: The current study (N = 33 undergraduate students) utilized a measure of implicit cognition, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to independently analyze disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. In addition, a series of behavioral approach tasks (BAT) and questionnaires measuring general disgust, obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies and general psychopathology were implemented to validate the implicit measures. Results: Disgust sensitivity predicted avoidance behavior on the BATs independent of disgust propensity and anxiety, while disgust propensity did not. Both disgust propensity and sensitivity predicted self-reported OC tendencies and individually predicted obsessing and washing concerns, respectively. Limitations: Our findings are based on a non-clinical student sample and further research is required for generalization to OCD. Conclusions: The implicit measures appeared to be measuring two separate constructs and had differential relationships with behavior and OC tendencies. Overall, the results support current theories relating to pathological disgust and OCD.

Participants first completed the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) followed by one of two verbal rehearsal tasks, one of which focused on fear acceptance and the other on fear reduction as ways of coping with fear. All participants then completed two IRAPs similar to those employed by Leech, Barnes-Holmes, and Madden (The Psychological Record, 66(3), doi: 10.1007/s40732-016-0176-1 , 2016). Finally, participants completed the BAT using a live common house spider. Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. No significant differences between the two verbal-rehearsal conditions emerged on the self-report measures, the IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated in the reduce-fear condition. When considered in the context of the results previously reported by Leech et al., the differential pattern of correlations observed in the current study suggest that the verbal rehearsal task impacted upon a behavior–behavior relation that may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the acceptance and commitment therapy literature.

However, the mechanisms by which specific intervention strategies exert their effect have not been clearly identified. Objective: This study investigated the prospective relationships between two psychological processes, an attentional bias toward cocaine stimuli and beliefs about the consequences of cocaine use, and treatment outcome. Method: Twenty-five cocaine-dependent participants enrolled in a 6-month outpatient treatment program that included voucher incentives for abstinence. All participants were asked to complete two implicit assessment procedures, a Drug Stroop protocol and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as well as explicit measures of cocaine craving and the consequences of cocaine use, prior to beginning treatment. Pearson’s correlation coefficients tested the prospective relationships between treatment outcome and the implicit and explicit assessments. Results: Stronger implicit beliefs about the positive effects of cocaine use prior to treatment were associated with poorer treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was in place. Further, an attentional bias for cocaine-related stimuli was associated with better treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was removed. No association between cocaine use beliefs and treatment outcome was found when beliefs were measured with self-report instruments. Conclusions and scientific significance: These findings highlight the potential utility of performance-based measures for delineating the psychological mechanisms associated with variation in response to treatment for drug dependence.

Based on recent psychological models of PNESs, it was hypothesized that nonepileptic seizures would be associated with implicit and explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance. Explicit anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; implicit anxiety was measured by an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; and experiential avoidance was measured with the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire. Although both groups with epilepsy and PNESs scored similarly on implicit measures of anxiety, significant implicit–explicit anxiety discrepancies were only identified in patients with PNESs (p < .001). In the group with PNESs (but not in the group with epilepsy), explicit anxiety correlated with experiential avoidance (r = .63, p < .01) and frequency of seizures (r = .67, p < .01); implicit anxiety correlated with frequency of seizures only (r = .56, p < .01).

A broadly similar pattern of response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar' Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by Leech et al.

Across four studies, we developed and validated implicit measures of competence need satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together, these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence. Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low reliability of the IRAP.","2018-10","2018-12-23 12:00:03","2023-01-10 18:48:25","","615-637","","5","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/M236NTGZ/van der Kaap-Deeder et al. - 2018 - The development and validation of an implicit meas.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop an answer to this central problem in the study of social movements, this paper investigates the possible role of cognitive mechanisms using the framework of System Justification Theory. It examines the explicit and implicit attitudes of London bankers and Occupy St. Paul's protesters towards capitalism and an alternative economic system (Resource Based Economy: RBE) using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure and questionnaires. As hypothesised, bankers were more likely than protesters to demonstrate positive attitudes towards conservative capitalistic worldviews/values on both explicit and implicit measures. Also as expected, protesters had more positive explicit attitudes towards the RBE than did bankers. However, implicit attitudes towards the RBE were neutral for both groups. The implicit capitalism measures correlated positively with the explicit Capitalism Semantic Differential Scales (SDS) and negatively with the RBE SDS. No correlations were found between the implicit RBE measures and any of the explicit SDSs. The central theoretical insight of this paper is that implicit attitudes play an important role in maintaining the status quo, and that cognitive factors may underpin the resilience of extant social, political and economic structures.","2015-05-04","2018-12-23 12:00:26","2023-01-10 19:04:24","","311-330","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/J3NCHFKZ/O'Shea - 2015 - Capitalism versus a new economic model Implicit a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implicit measures of cognition may shed light on the role of future thinking in depression. To our knowledge, the current study presents the first implicit measure of positive and negative future thinking. A sample of 71 volunteers (38 healthy; 33 with sub-clinical depression) completed both implicit and explicit measures of positive and negative future thinking. The findings indicate differences in the evaluation of both positive and negative future events between the two groups. However, group differences were more pronounced on the implicit measure.

This is typically measured with rating scales depicting a series of body silhouettes of increasing size, from extreme thinness to fatness. Respondents mark the points that match their current body size and the one they would ideally like to be (the more distance between both, the more body dissatisfaction). Like all self-reports, these scales are liable to self-presentation biases. Experimental procedures that require respondents to answer under time pressure (implicit measures) tap into more automatic reactions that are less amenable to deliberate manipulation. This study used one such procedure (the IRAP) to examine how rapidly participants identified themselves (or not) with pictures of underweight or overweight, and how rapidly they expressed a desire to be (or not) like such pictures. Participants did not show a clear discrepancy between their actual and their ideal body size with the IRAP. However, automatic reactions indicative of acceptance/rejection of the idea of becoming fatter, predicted the degree of body image distress as measured with different instruments. Unwillingness to accept this idea was associated with more severe symptoms of disordered eating. Background The discrepancy between actual and ideal body image is considered an index of body dissatisfaction and a risk factor for eating disorders. While discrepancy has been traditionally tested with figural drawing rating scales, in recent times the use of implicit measures has been explored. Methods This study employs the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to examine actual-ideal body-size discrepancy in a sample of 130 Spanish college students, as well as its utility to predict symptoms of eating disorders and other body-image relevant measures. Participants completed the Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS). The three smallest and the three largest contour drawings of the CDRS were used as target stimuli in two different IRAP tasks: one in combination with the sample phrases “I am” and “I am not” (that assessed implicit actual body image), another in combination with the phrases “I want to be” and “I don't want to be” (that assessed implicit ideal body image). After completing both IRAP tasks, participants completed explicit measures of body-image psychological inflexibility, body dissatisfaction, and symptoms of eating disorders. Results Results showed a small implicit bias towards thinness. Participants were faster in affirming than denying that they are thin and that they desire to be thin. They were also faster in affirming than denying that they are fat and that they want to be fat, but to a smaller extent than with thinness. Specifically, the implicit desire to be (or not be) fat emerged as an independent predictor of eating disorder symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and body dissatisfaction that significantly increased the predictive power of CDRS scores. Conclusions These findings underscore the need for further research on specific body image implicit beliefs towards fatness, both in subclinical and clinical populations, in order to examine whether willingness to accept the idea that one can have a larger body size can be a suitable target for prevention and intervention in eating disorders.","2021-07-08","2022-09-12 05:52:01","2023-01-10 18:52:11","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/TSENJA2R/Hernández-López et al. - 2021 - Testing the discrepancy between actual and ideal b.pdf","","Body dissatisfaction; Body image; Figural drawings; Gender differences; Implicit attitudes; Implicit relational assessment procedure; IRAP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite these trends, however, self-report data may fall victim to a range of confounds including self-presentational biases. Recently, researchers have begun to assess implicit homo-negativity (i.e., attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women that are relatively unconscious and beyond volitional control) using a range of implicit measures. This chapter reviews the studies published to date in the area of implicit homo-negativity. The findings show that implicit attitudes as measured by the Implicit Association Test, the Sequential Priming Procedure and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure differ as a function of group status (i.e., heterosexual versus non-heterosexual). Specifically, implicit in-group ""pride"" and out-group ""prejudice"" were repeatedly produced by heterosexual participants. In contrast, non-heterosexuals were relatively egalitarian in their expression of implicit attitudes. Furthermore, in many of the studies, a divergence in performance between implicit and explicit attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women was observed.

The IRAPs differed solely in the different types of response option used: contextually cued relational responses (C-rels) or relational coherence indicators (RCIs). The terms “same”/”opposite” served as C-rel response options whereas the RCI response options were “right”/”wrong.” The expected IRAP effect was evident on D-scores from both IRAPs. This effect was shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used (Wilk's Lambda = .86, F (1, 36) = 6.05, p = .02, eta(2)(p) = .14.), however, there was no statistically significant effect shown for the order of their presentation, nor were any other interaction effects detected.

Relational frame theory (RFT) has provided a behavioral account of performances on true and false belief protocols by appealing to the three perspective-taking (deictic) relations. The current research sought to investigate the relative strength of cognitive perspective-taking abilities within the context of a false belief vignette and related IRAP. Experiment 1 investigated the impact of block order presentation and vignette stimuli order on IRAP performances. That is, across four conditions, rule order presentations (i.e., vignette consistent vs. vignette inconsistent) and vignette stimuli presentation were manipulated. Results indicated that vignette consistent responding was observed to varying degrees across conditions. To decrease this variability across conditions, Experiment 2 presented a vignette before each block of trials but again the IRAP showed only limited sensitivity to the vignette.

IRAP data showed a statistically significant implicit preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, for both post-primary and university students, with no statistically significant difference between these groups. There was no difference in IRAP results pre and post a brief educational intervention, thus the research did not support the intervention.

The findings of Experiment 1 contrast with the clear evidence of a transformation of functions via mutually entailed relations that was reported by Leech et al. (2018), thus suggesting a potential boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and testing context (i.e., derived transformation occurs for mutual but not combinatorial entailing). In Experiment 2, we sought to manipulate two of the dimensions of the multi-dimensional multi-level (MDML) framework to determine if they would alter the apparent boundary condition suggested by the results of Experiment 1.

The aim of the current research was to develop IRAPs that targeted deictic relational responding with regard to the mental states of self and others. This was pursued in a series of experiments that employed a novel version of the IRAP, known as the Natural Language-IRAP (NL-IRAP). The use of the NL-IRAP allowed for the presentation of relatively complex statements that required participants to infer the thoughts or beliefs of others on a trial-by-trial basis within the IRAP. Across a sequence of six experiments, a 'self-focused IRAP' required participants to respond to both positive and negative statements about themselves, whereas an 'other-focused IRAP' required participants to respond to similar statements about others. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated perspective-taking with regard to an unspecified other. Experiments 3–6 investigated perspective-taking with regard to a specified other, with the specified relationship between self and other manipulated across experiments. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that the other-focused IRAP produced overall bias scores that were significantly stronger than responding to the self-focused IRAP. It is interesting that nonsignificant differences were recorded across Experiments 3–6 when other was specified. The findings obtained across the six studies highlight potentially important limitations in the use of the NL-IRAP as a measure of perspective-taking.

This study aimed to explore the factor of common humanity (the belief that suffering is a shared human experience) and whether people tend to identify with this factor more in relation to their own experiences or those of others. Previously, it has been suggested that when applying compassion, people tend to be harsher on themselves and more compassionate toward others. Most research in self-compassion has typically used explicit measures, which can be scientifically limiting. The present study employed an implicit measure, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to explore this domain. Participants (N = 55) completed the IRAP and its analog scale as well as Neff's self-compassion scale. Results showed that explicitly, participants reported high levels of common humanity and lack of isolation for both themselves as well as others. Implicitly, however, while they showed similar patterns in three of these four trial-types (i.e., common humanity regarding self and others and isolation with respect to others) they were neutral regarding self-isolation. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Thus two IRAPs (one with adult pictorial stimuli and one with child pictorial stimuli) were employed to assess implicit gender bias toward STEM with a sample of undergraduates (N = 33). Results indicated a gender STEM bias in both IRAPs and the directionality in both IRAPs was pro-male and not anti-female. Participant gender was not shown to impact results in either IRAP.

Recent research has highlighted the role of the stimulus orienting function on IRAP performance. The present study used the IRAP to assess preference biases for smartphone application (app) icons, namely WhatsApp and Messenger, and intended to check if these biases correspond to the orienting function of these stimuli in a visual search paradigm monitored by eye tracking. The IRAP presented relations between the WhatsApp and Messenger icons and happy or angry facial expressions. The visual search task had two steps: in Step 1, matrices of app icons were designed to emulate smartphone screens, and the participant was instructed to find either the WhatsApp or the Messenger icon; in Step 2, happy or angry faces were presented as targets in matrices of pictures of neutral faces that functioned as distractors. Participants were more prompted to respond Yes than No to the relation between the WhatsApp icon and happy facial expressions in IRAP trials, and showed ambivalent bias to the Messenger icon. Regarding the visual search performance, participants’ were faster to find the WhatsApp target than to find the Messenger target. In addition, they were faster to find the happy targets than the angry targets. Results from the current study corroborate the hypothesis that the stimulus orienting function may play an important role on IRAP performance and, as a result, are supportive to the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model.

Change agendas that lead people to think that 'reducing or removing undesirable thoughts and feelings will solve problems and lead to a more successful life' are considered unworkable in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). For acceptance-based interventions to succeed, relinquishing change agendas is important. However, currently available methods for measuring these types of change agendas are limited to explicit measures, which are vulnerable to distortion from social desirability and demand characteristics. The authors attempted to measure change agendas using the IRAP. A total of 131 undergraduate and graduate students (40 male, 91 female; mean age = 21.93, SD = 3.19) participated. First, we examined the CA-IRAP’s discriminant validity in relation to explicit measures such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II in 83 participants who were able to pass the CA-IRAP. The correlations between the CA-IRAP and the explicit measures were low, confirming the discriminant validity of the CA-IRAP. Second, we examined the predictive validity of the CA-IRAP. Nineteen respondents had learned ACT and 34 respondents had never learned ACT. Non-ACT learners’ CA-IRAP scores were higher than those of ACT learners, which confirmed the CA-IRAP’s predictive validity. Finally, we examined the CA-IRAP’s test–retest reliability, which was confirmed across some CA-IRAP trial types. In conclusion, the authors submit that the CA-IRAP has strong potential as a valid instrument for measuring the relative strength of relational responses around change agendas while controlling for variables such as demand characteristics.

To account for the phenomenon, the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model of IRAP performance was proposed. The DAARRE model predicts the STTDE in terms of an overlap in the functional properties of the label, target, and response-option stimuli presented within an IRAP. This article presents an initial attempt at engineering a STTDE within an experimental session. Forty participants were exposed to a series of training procedures and IRAPs. The training procedures consisted of a series of trials that aimed to establish a 'True' function for a picture stimulus that was subsequently presented in the IRAP; participants were then exposed to an IRAP in which participants were required to respond 'True' on a specific trial-type that presented that picture.

Both instruments included the names of careers stereotypically regarded as 'male' or 'female' and words indicating gender.

A significant implicit pro-men–male career bias was mostly more substantial among male students. In the explicit scales, participants tended to show a more neutral evaluation (not classifying careers as 'male' or 'female'). Correlations were found between explicit evaluations for male careers and the implicit trial type 'women–male careers,' indicating that the more a career was explicitly evaluated as male, the more easily it was related with 'women' as false at the implicit level.

Based on this framework, we investigated whether in individuals with low ideal self-esteem (moderator), a positive relationship between actual self-esteem and reactive autonomic regulation would be mediated by the amount of anticipatory autonomic regulation. Methods: Forty-five healthy females prepared a speech (i.e., anticipation) and performed it in front of a camera (i.e., stressor). Actual and ideal self-esteem were measured with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. Anticipatory and reactive autonomic stress regulation were indexed by heart rate variability, and affective responses were assessed via self-report. Results: Results were in line with predictions based on the NFRE: when ideal self-esteem was low, higher actual self-esteem was associated with higher reactive autonomic regulation, and this association was mediated by higher anticipatory autonomic regulation. Limitations: Because only female undergraduates were recruited, replication within a more heterogeneous sample is necessary to further generalize these findings. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis, based on the NFRE, that actual and ideal self-esteem interact in predicting the relationship between anticipatory and reactive stress regulation, and are a step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying successful stress regulation.

Gender bias relational responses may be brought under the functional control of situational social variables, such as responding in a mixed gender group or responding in a single gender group (women only/men only). One hundred and ten undergraduates (65 women and 45 men; aged 18–22) performed a collective IRAP application about gender stereotypes. In the first experimental condition, the test was applied in mixed gender groups. In the second experimental condition, the test was applied in single gender groups. The results showed that gender stereotypes were present in men’s and women’s responses to the IRAP. Both male and female participants showed greater gender bias when responding in single gender groups than in mixed gender groups in all the IRAP trial types. The social context in which IRAP was applied influenced the participant's performance. The advantages of collective IRAP applications are also discussed.

College students (N = 41) were trained to establish two classes of equivalent stimuli, each comprising a happy or an angry emoji, and three pseudo-words that presumably became symbols of the emotional pictographs. In a subsequent IRAP test, combinations of symbols (labels) and emojis (targets) generated four trialtypes (with the consistent response within parentheses): happy symbol–happy emoji (true); happy symbol–negative emoji (false) negative symbol–happy emoji (false); and negative symbol–negative emoji (true), referred to as trial types 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A positive score occurred only for trial-type 1 [happy symbol–happy emoji (true)]. Scores for trial-types 2 and 4 were close to zero, and the score for trial-type 3 [negative symbolhappy emoji (false)] was negative. This negative D-IRAP score means that participants were faster to respond true than false for the combination of negative symbol and happy emoji. These results are discussed in terms of the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model. It is hypothesized that the orienting and evoking (functional) properties of the positive target stimulus (happy emoji) and the positive response option (true) had a stronger bearing on participants’ responding in trial type 3 than the relation between the label and target stimuli presented in this trial. We argue that the current study provides an empirical demonstration of a dissonant target trial type effect (DTTTE) that appeared to counter equivalence relations trained within the experimental session and discuss implications for IRAP research.

In the classic IRAP procedure, we formed four sets of stimuli based on the relationship between power words (powerful and powerless words) and vertical position on a computer screen (upper or lower) that were either pro-metaphor (i.e., powerful-high, powerless-low) or anti-metaphor (i.e., powerful-low, powerless-high). Participants were then asked to judge whether the words were consistent or inconsistent with the set of instructions given to them. We found that the Dirap scores of powerful words in an above vertical space and powerless words in a below vertical space were higher than zero. Furthermore, the Dirap scores of the pro-metaphor stimuli were significantly greater than were those of the anti-metaphor stimuli. Vertical spatial position metaphor of power concepts was verified again by IRAP. These findings suggest that there is an established spatial metaphor for power, which we explain using relational frame theory. It is the first study to our knowledge to explore this metaphor using the IRAP, which overcomes the limitations of paradigms such as the implicit association test, and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of the metaphor.

The extant evidence reveals an implicit weight bias in the general population that has generally been interpreted in terms of anti-fat attitudes. However, research with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) shows that this bias appears to be driven by pro-slim rather than anti-fat implicit attitudes. Besides, the only IRAP study of this sort conducted in Spain found no evidence of such implicit weight bias (with similarly positive attitudes to thinness and fatness). Given the existing differences in body dissatisfaction (BD) among diverse cultural contexts, we predicted that discrepancies in findings about implicit weight bias might be related to differences in BD amongst the samples in the different studies. This study explores whether women with extreme scores in BD (High vs. Low) show different patterns of attitudes to female body shape. Spanish female college students with extreme scores in the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ: high ≥ 104, percentile 80; low ≤ 52, percentile 20) completed an IRAP with pictures of overweight and underweight women as target stimuli and the words pleasant and unpleasant as labels. Participants also completed explicit ratings to the same stimuli and clinically relevant measures of body image related distress. Results showed an implicit weight bias only for women high in BD. While both groups showed equally positive implicit attitudes to thinness, only women with low BD showed implicit positive attitudes to fatness (and hence no bias). In turn, both groups presented a clear pro-thin/anti-fat explicit bias with positive ratings for underweight pictures and negative ratings for overweight pictures. The latter were stronger for the high BD group. Therefore, between-group differences were mainly driven by differences in attitudes to fatness (both implicit and explicit). Both implicit and explicit attitudes to fatness independently predicted eating disorders symptoms and other clinically relevant measures. These results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications.

Experiment 2 aimed to explore the use of different types of stimuli (i.e., pictures as well as words), that again focused on self-related stimulus relations, and their potential correlations with measures of self-esteem and psychological distress. Experiment 1 yielded broadly similar findings to those reported previously. Experiment 2 showed that only one trial type from the IRAP using pictures depicting success versus failure correlated with the measures of self-esteem and psychological distress; none of the remaining 11 trial types across the three IRAPs yielded any significant correlations. The current findings may be seen as relatively progressive when presented in the context of a theoretical model that may be used, albeit in a post-hoc manner, to interpret the specific IRAP response patterns obtained in the current and previously published research. In particular, an in-depth RFT conceptual analysis of the findings using a recently proposed model of IRAP effects is presented.

Participants then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and rating scales to assess implicit and explicit bias respectively. Men and women STEM students exhibited a statistically significant, large implicit pro-Men-STEM bias while women also demonstrated a significant pro-Women-STEM bias. Explicitly, both groups demonstrated a Male-STEM/Female-Arts bias. While selection task scores were not significantly biased, they did correlate with implicit scores on the Men-STEM IRAP trial-type. The results highlighted the subtle nuances that can be revealed by assessing both implicit and explicit gender-STEM biases, particularly when utilizing a measure such as the IRAP.

This preliminary study sought to determine the feasibility of using matched pictures of self and of others across two IRAPs (N = 32). Both the self- and other-IRAPs also presented pictures of pens as the contrast category. The results of the IRAPs were broadly consistent with common-sense expectations. That is, participants confirmed more readily than they denied that a picture of a face was a face and that a picture of a pen was a pen. They also denied more readily than confirmed that a picture of a pen was a face and that a picture of a face was a pen. No significant differences in the sizes of the individual trial type effects, or differences among those effects, emerged between the two (self and other) IRAPs. However, two key differential trial type effects did emerge for both IRAPs, which relate directly to recent and on-going conceptual developments surrounding the IRAP and the analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding in general.

Psychometric studies using the TBC have presented evidence of its validity and reliability in different cultures. However, TBC content validity is exclusively based on self-reported measurements, which presents limitations that are widely discussed in the literature. Our study sought to investigate an alternative measurement for TBC content validity using a latency-based task, namely the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The main objective was to assess the strength of the relationship between the concept of 'Good Teacher' and 'Bad Teacher' and six positive and negative features derived from TBC items using an IRAP preparation. The second objective was to investigate the correlation between IRAP and TBC scores. The participants were 64 undergraduate students (M = 21; F = 43), aged 16 to 36. The IRAP trials included six target stimuli selected from the TBC that could be either 'Good Teacher' or 'Bad Teacher,' and six labels that could be either positive or negative features. The IRAP revealed that the 'Good Teacher' is 'Positive,' not 'Negative.' On the other hand, the 'Bad Teacher' is 'Negative,' but participants could not deny that this teacher has 'Positive' features. Only one statistically significant correlation was found between the Good Teacher-Negative IRAP trial type and the TBC score. Future studies should expand the use of implicit measurements in psychometric studies using the TBC.

No significant difference was found between the private and public contexts, F(1, 46) = 0.7780, p = 0.3824. A significant bias in favor of women dressed in modest clothing was observed in the overall scores for the public context, t(23) = 5.272, p < 0.0001; additional analyses for individual trial types are included. These results may suggest that, although participants did not demonstrate significant bias against women dressed in revealing clothes, a bias in favor of women dressed modestly was present.

When humans match dissimilar stimuli (e.g., words to pictures), equivalence relations between those stimuli are likely to be demonstrated through behavioral tests derived from the logical properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. If these properties are confirmed, one can say that those stimuli are members of an equivalence class in which each member is substitutable for the others. A number of studies, which have established equivalence classes comprised of arbitrary stimuli and pictures of faces expressing emotions, have found that valences of the faces affect the relatedness of equivalent stimuli. Importantly, several studies reported stronger relational strength in equivalence classes containing happy faces than in equivalence classes containing angry faces. The processes that may account for this higher degree of relatability of happy faces are not yet known. The current study investigated the dynamics of the symbolic relational responding involving facial expressions of different emotions by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were 186 undergraduate students who were taught to establish two equivalence classes, each comprising pictures of faces expressing either happiness (for one class) or a negative emotion (for another class), and meaningless words. The IRAP effect was taken as an index for the relational strength established between equivalent stimuli in the different equivalence classes. The dynamics of arbitrary relational responding in the course of the four IRAP trial types revealed that the participants exhibited a stronger IRAP effect in trials involving the happy faces and a weaker IRAP effect in trials involving the negative faces. These findings indicate that the happy faces had higher impact on the symbolic relational responding than the negative faces. The potential role played by the orienting function of happy vs. negative faces is discussed. By considering other studies that also reported a happiness superiority effect in other contexts, we present converging evidence for the prioritization of positive affect in emotional, categorical, and symbolic processing.

The IRAPs were similar except for the response options used, which were either 'Same'/'Opposite' (Crels) versus 'Accurate'/'Inaccurate' (RCIs). D-scores for both IRAPs showed the expected IRAP effect (bias).

There was no statistically significant interaction effect shown between response option used and order of completion (i.e., Crel IRAP first vs. RCI IRAP first), however, there was a statistically significant interaction effect shown between type of response options used on the IRAP, order of completion, and block-order presentation (consistent trial-blocks vs. inconsistent trial blocks presented first).

The reduction of this bias is a key consideration as it remains a major barrier to gender equality in STEM. The interventions (psychoeducation, exposure to positive counter-stereotypical exemplars and perspective-taking) were compared to a control group at two timepoints. Gender-STEM bias was assessed at the implicit level (via the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; IRAP) and the explicit level (via rating scales). Two hundred and ten adults (58.1% women) completed one of the four study conditions. Results indicated that implicit gender-STEM bias is malleable, at least in the short term. At Time 1, intervention groups showed higher levels of implicit pro-Women-STEM bias and lower levels of pro-Men-STEM bias than the Control group. Psychoeducation appeared most effective, followed by exposure to positive counter-stereotypical exemplars. Results from Time 2 presented a more complex picture of implicit bias change, as the control group exhibited an increased pro-Women-STEM bias that was unexpected. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to refining the interventions, the malleability of gender-STEM bias and the measurement of implicit bias across contexts.

These dysfunctional beliefs are presented in the form of rules, verbal statements that specify what responsibilities one should expect in order to be a 'good caregiver,' and are characterized as rigid, unrealistic, or highly demanding. Previous studies relied exclusively on self-report measures when assessing such dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop and validate an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving (CARE-IRAP), and 2) considering the relatively high age of the sample, to analyze the adaptation of the IRAP for older adults, comparing the IRAP performance between older adult caregivers and middle-aged caregivers. Participants were 123 dementia family caregivers with a mean age of 62.24 ± 12.89. Adaptations were made to the IRAP by adjusting the accuracy and response time criteria. The sample was split into middle-aged caregivers (below 60 years) and older adult caregivers (60 or older). The CARE-IRAP scores presented significant positive correlations with explicit measures of dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and experiential avoidance in caregiving. A similar pattern of results was observed across the two age groups. The results revealed that caregivers endorse implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and offer preliminary support for the use of the IRAP as a valid measure of implicit caregiving beliefs. This exploratory study is the first to adapt the IRAP criteria to older adults, and future studies should further explore criteria suitable for this population.

Many communications by an organization's leadership may function as such and alter the function of stimuli in the workplace, which in turn may influence employee behaviors (Houmanfar & Rodrigues, Journal of Applied Radical Behavior Analysis, N1, 22–27, 2012). There is a lack of experimental research regarding this, however, particularly under different organizational pay systems (i.e., financial contingencies), which have been repeatedly shown to influence performance (e.g., Gupta & Shaw, Compensation and Benefits Review, 30(2), 26–32, 1998; Locke, Feren, McCaleb, Shaw, & Denny, 1980). The current study sought to compare the two by measuring the effect of motivational statements on individual versus cooperative responding under two different pay-for-performance contingencies in an organizational analogue. Stimuli for the motivational statements were selected utilizing an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) with one group of participants, and these statements were then tested under piece-rate and profit-share conditions with a second group of participants in a counterbalanced reversal design. Results indicated that the financial contingencies had more of an effect on responding, but that motivational statements influenced behavior as well. In particular, motivational statements affected whether a participant chose to cooperate or behave individually more under financially neutral conditions (i.e., profit share) when there was no financial cost for doing so. As such, organizations can utilize memos or speeches to increase performance, but it is important for the content to align with financial contingencies in order to maximize performance.

This was the purpose of the current study, which focused on manipulating three different motivating conditions related to stimuli presented during the IRAP task. First, two equivalence classes were established: A1-B1-C1-D1 and A2-B2-C2-D2. These classes comprised nonsense forms (B, C, and D) and two meaningful stimuli: a picture of a glass full of water (A1) and a neutral picture (A2). Derived transformation of function from the meaningful stimuli to two nonsense forms (D1 and D2) was then assessed by means of a semantic differential and an IRAP. Before assessment, participants were divided in three groups: the first had water intake; the second had pepper; the third had pepper before the semantic differential, followed by an extra dose before the IRAP testing blocks. Results suggest that the motivative conditions progressively affected both measures. Regarding the semantic differential, D1 (water) and D2 (neutral) stimuli were close to neutrality for the Water group; for the Pepper and Double Pepper groups, however, the D1 (water) stimulus had a positive valence whereas D2 (neutral) was neutral. In the IRAP, both the Water and Pepper group evaluated D1 as positive; nonetheless, for the Double Pepper group, IRAP scores revealed that D1 was even more positive compared to the other groups. Implications for the IRAP are discussed in terms of the DAARRE model.

Explicit assessment of aggressiveness in OCD has yielded diverging results. The present study aimed to investigate aggressiveness in OCD using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Method: Patients with OCD (n = 59) were compared to non-clinical controls (NCs; n = 31) on an IRAP using self-referential statements and the explicit State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II (STAXI-II). During the computer-based IRAP, participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately ('correct' or 'incorrect') to the relation of two presented stimuli (e.g., 'I am' + 'aggressive'). Results: DIRAP-Scores for the I am aggressive trial type were significantly higher in NCs compared to the OCD sample (d = 0.73). Patients with OCD scored significantly higher on the Trait Anger scales and the Anger Expression-Out scale of the STAXI-II. The I am aggressiveDIRAP-Score correlated with the overall Trait Anger scale (r = −.33, p = .001) and with the Anger Expression-In scale (r = −0.31, p = .003). Conclusions: Patients with OCD were more ambivalent about their own aggressiveness than NCs. These findings were in line with patients’ explicit aggressiveness.

The current study examined the impact of a fear-related verbal-rehearsal task on performance on two implicit relational assessment procedures (IRAPs), actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT. The study was conducted over 3 separate days. Day 1 involved exposure to a series of questionnaires, the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and homework. Day 2 involved a second exposure to the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. The final day involved a second exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., control, accept, or reduce fear). Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. (2017). No significant differences between the conditions emerged on the self-report measures, IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated almost exclusively in the control and reduce-fear conditions rather than the accept-fear condition. The replication of results reported here provide further evidence of the functional independence of approach and avoidance responding. Furthermore, the differential pattern of correlations observed provide further evidence that the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task affected a behavior-behavior relation, which may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the ACT literature. In addition, the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model offers an alternative explanation for the results reported.","2022-03","2022-09-12 05:52:05","2023-01-10 19:01:49","","89-104","","1","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/JVHCWLX7/Leech and Barnes-Holmes - 2022 - Fear and Avoidance A Three-Day Investigation on t.pdf","","Avoidance; DAARRE; Fear; IRAP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Causal attributions and implicit attitudes toward ethnic minority students predict preservice teachers' judgments about achievement","Frontiers in Psychology","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2022.819793","","In many educational systems, ethnic minority students score lower in their academic achievement, and consequently, teachers develop low expectations regarding this student group. Relatedly, teachers' implicit attitudes, explicit expectations, and causal attributions also differ between ethnic minority and ethnic majority students-all in a disadvantageous way for ethnic minority students. However, what is not known so far, is how attitudes and causal attributions contribute together to teachers' judgments. In the current study, we explored how implicit attitudes and causal attributions contribute to preservice teachers' judgments of the low educational success of an ethnic minority student. Results showed that both implicit attitudes and causal attributions predicted language proficiency and intelligence judgments. Negative implicit attitudes, assessed with the IRAP, and internal stable causal attributions led to lower judgments of language proficiency, whereas lower judgments of intelligence were predicted by positive implicit attitudes and higher judgments of intelligence by external stable attributions. Substantial differences in the prediction of judgments could be found between the IRAP and BIAT as measures of implicit attitudes.","2022-03-31","2022-09-12 05:52:04","2023-01-10 18:59:03","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/NKDIVXAB/Glock et al. - 2022 - Why Is Murat's Achievement So Low Causal Attribut.pdf","","causal attribution; ethnic bias; ethnic minority students; implicit attitudes; teacher judgment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal can reduce adherence to vaccination campaigns, and therefore undermine their effectiveness. Although the scientific community has made great efforts to understand the psychological causes of vaccine hesitancy, studies on vaccine intention have usually relied on traditional detection techniques, such as questionnaires. Probing these constructs explicitly could be problematic due to defense mechanisms or social desirability. Thus, a measure capable of detecting implicit attitudes towards vaccination is needed. To achieve this aim, we designed and validated a new test called the Vaccine-IRAP, or V-IRAP, which is a modified version of the original Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, or IRAP, task. The V-IRAP allows the unspoken reasons behind vaccine hesitancy to be investigated, and is able to distinguish between positive and negative beliefs on vaccination. The test was assessed in a sample of 151 participants. The V-IRAP showed good internal reliability and convergent validity, with meaningful correlational patterns with explicit measures. Moreover, it revealed incremental validity over such explicit measures. Lastly, the V-IRAP was able to shed light on the implicit attitudes involved in vaccine refusal, revealing negative attitudes relative to vaccine-related risks in non-vaccinated participants. Overall, these results support V-IRAP as a sensitive and reliable tool that could be used in future studies on implicit attitudes toward vaccination.","2022-01","2022-09-12 05:46:36","2023-01-10 19:07:55","2022-09-12 05:46:36","4205","","7","19","","","How Implicit Attitudes toward Vaccination Affect Vaccine Hesitancy and Behaviour","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/QWXMMLKT/Simione et al. - 2022 - How Implicit Attitudes toward Vaccination Affect V.pdf; /Users/Ian/Zotero Data/storage/KLLDPWJJ/4205.html","","","COVID-19; implicit attitudes; IRAP; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine propensity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
