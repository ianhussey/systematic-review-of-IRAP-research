Abstract = {{The AT(4) ligands, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, elicit robust
   effects on facilitating memory by binding to a specific site in the
   brain historically termed the angiotensin AT(4) receptor. The
   identification of the AT(4) receptor as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase
   (IRAP) is controversial, with other proteins speculated to be the
   target(s) of these peptides. In this study we have utilized IRAP
   knockout mice to investigate IRAP in the brain. We demonstrate that the
   high-affinity binding site for angiotensin IV is absent in IRAP knockout
   mice brain sections in parallel with the loss of IRAP immunostaining,
   providing irrefutable proof that IRAP is the specific high-affinity
   binding site for AT(4) ligands. However, our characterization of the
   behavioural phenotype of the IRAP knockout mice revealed a totally
   unexpected finding. In contrast to the acute effects of IRAP inhibitors
   in enhancing memory, deletion of the IRAP gene resulted in mice with an
   accelerated, age-related decline in spatial memory that was only
   detected in the Y maze paradigm. Moreover, no alterations in behaviour
   of the IRAP knockout mice were observed that could assist in elucidating
   the endogenous substrate(s). Our results highlight the importance of
   analysing the behavioural phenotype of knockout mice across different

   raises the possibility that TRAP ligands may facilitate memory in
   hippocampus-dependent tasks through enhancement of hippocampal glucose
   uptake. Acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 1 nmol
   Ang IV or 0.1 nmol LVV-H7 in 3 months-old Sprague-Dawley rats enhanced
   spatial working memory in the plus maze spontaneous alternation task.
   Extracellular hippocampal glucose levels were monitored before, during
   and after behavioral testing using in vivo microdialysis. Extracellular
   hippocampal glucose levels decreased significantly to about 70\% of
   baseline when the animals explored the plus maze, but remained constant
   when the animals were placed into a novel control chamber. Ang IV and
   LVV-H7 did not significantly alter hippocampal glucose levels compared

   had no effect on hippocampal blood flow as determined by laser Doppler

Abstract = {{It is proposed that insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is the site
   of action of two peptides, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, which
   have facilitatory effects on learning and memory. In fat and muscles,
   IRAP codistributes with the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4
   in specialised vesicles, where it plays a role in the tethering and/or
   trafficking of these vesicles. This study investigated whether an
   analogous system exists in two functionally distinct regions of the
   brain, the hippocampus and the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, IRAP was
   found in the pyramidal neurones where it exhibited a high degree of
   colocalisation with GLUT4. Consistent with the role of GLUT4 in
   insulin-responsive tissues, the glucose transporter was thought to be
   responsible for facilitating glucose uptake into these pyramidal
   neurones in response to potassium-induced depolarisation or cAMP
   activation as the glucose influx was sensitive to indinavir treatment.
   Angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 enhanced this activity-dependent
   glucose uptake in hippocampal slices. In contrast, in the cerebellum,
   where the distribution of IRAP was dissociated from GLUT4, the effect of
   the peptides on glucose uptake was absent. We propose that the
   modulation of glucose uptake by angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 is
   region-specific and is critically dependent on a high degree of
   colocalisation between IRAP and GLUT4. These findings also confirm a
   role for IRAP and GLUT4 in activity-dependent glucose uptake in
   hippocampal neurones.}},

Abstract = {{Angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 promote robust enhancing effects on
   learning and memory. These peptides are also competitive inhibitors of
   the insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase, suggesting that the
   biological actions of these peptides may result from inhibition of IRAP
   activity. However, the normal function of IRAP in the brain is yet to be
   determined. The present study investigated the sub-cellular distribution
   of IRAP in four neuronal cell lines and in the mouse brain. Using
   sub-cellular fractionation, IRAP was found to be enriched in low density
   microsomes, while lower levels of IRAP were also present in high density
   microsomes, plasma membrane and mitochondrial fractions. Dual-label
   immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of IRAP in vesicles
   colocalized with the vesicular maker VAMP2, in the trans Golgi network
   co-localized with TGN 38 and in endosomes co- localized with EEA1.
   Finally using electron microscopy, IRAP specific immunoreactivity was
   predominantly associated with large 100-200 nm vesicles in hippocampal
   neurons. The location, appearance and size of these vesicles are
   consistent with neurosecretory vesicles. IRAP precipitate was also
   detected in intracellular structures including the rough endoplasmic
   reticulum, Golgi stack and mitochondrial membranes. The sub-cellular
   localization of IRAP in neurons demonstrated in the present study bears
   striking parallels with distribution of IRAP in insulin responsive
   cells, where the enzyme plays a role in insulin-regulated glucose
   uptake. Therefore, we propose that the function of IRAP in neurons may
   be similar to that in insulin responsive cells.}},

Abstract = {{Locally administered angiotensin IV causes a dose-dependent increase of
   the dopamine levels in the striatum of the rat. The aminopeptidases
   insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and/or aminopeptidase N (AP-N)
   are proposed to be involved in this effect since both enzymes are
   inhibited by angiotensin IV. In agreement with this hypothesis we
   demonstrate that by using the AP-N selective inhibitor 7B, about 60\% of
   the aminopeptidase activity in striatal membranes could be attributed to
   AP-N (pK(i)=9.20). Higher concentrations of 713 are capable of
   inhibiting IRAP as well (pK(i)=7.26). Interestingly, in vivo, inhibition
   of IRAP or AP-N activity does not appear to be involved in the
   angiotensin IV-mediated effect in the striatum since 7B itself is not
   capable to induce dopamine release such as observed with angiotensin IV.
   However, 713 at a concentration selective for inhibition of AP-N (100
   nM) potentiates the angiotensin IV-mediated increase of dopamine,
   suggesting that inhibition of AP-N lengthens the half-life of
   angiotensin IV. On the other hand, inhibition of both AP-N and IRAP by
   perfusion of 500 nM 7B completely abolishes the effect of angiotensin
   IV. We therefore hypothesize that the effect of angiotensin IV on
   dopamine release in the striatum is mediated via activation of IRAP
   and/or AP-N, possibly acting as receptors for angiotensin IV. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Motivation: Experimental limitations in high-throughput protein-protein
   interaction detection methods have resulted in low quality interaction
   datasets that contained sizable fractions of false positives and false
   negatives. Small-scale, focused experiments are then needed to
   complement the high-throughput methods to extract true protein
   interactions. However, the naturally vast interactomes would require
   much more scalable approaches.
   Results: We describe a novel method called IRAP({*}) as a computational
   complement for repurification of the highly erroneous experimentally
   derived protein interactomes. Our method involves an iterative process
   of removing interactions that are confidently identified as false
   positives and adding interactions detected as false negatives into the
   interactomes. Identification of both false positives and false negatives
   are performed in IRAP({*}) using interaction confidence measures based
   on network topological metrics. Potential false positives are identified
   amongst the detected interactions as those with very low computed
   confidence values, while potential false negatives are discovered as the
   undetected interactions with high computed confidence values. Our
   results from applying IRAP({*}) on large-scale interaction datasets
   generated by the popular yeast-two-hybrid assays for yeast, fruit fly
   and worm showed that the computationally repurified interaction datasets
   contained potentially lower fractions of false positive and false
   negative errors based on functional homogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The anti-convulsant properties of angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an inhibitor
   of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and somatostatin-14, a
   substrate of IRAP, were evaluated in the acute pilocarpine rat seizure
   model. Simultaneously, the neurochemical changes in the hippocampus were
   monitored using in vivo microdialysis. Intracerebroventricularly
   (i.c.v.) administered Ang IV or somatostatin-14 caused a significant
   increase in the hippocampal extracellular dopamine and serotonin levels
   and protected rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures. These effects
   of Ang IV were both blocked by concomitant i.c.v. administration of the
   somatostatin receptor-2 antagonist cyanamid 154806. These results reveal
   a possible role for dopamine and serotonin in the anti-convulsant effect
   of Ang IV and somatostatin-14. Our study suggests that the ability of
   Ang IV to inhibit pilocarpine-induced convulsions is dependent on
   somatostatin receptor-2 activation, and is possibly mediated via the
   inhibition of IRAP resulting in an elevated concentration of
   somatostatin-14 in the brain.}},
