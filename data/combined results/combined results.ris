T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Women remain under-represented in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM), constituting only 28% of science researchers worldwide. Research has identified implicit gender-bias as a major barrier to women's progression in these fields. Previous research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) suggests that individuals studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for the development of interventions. If this relational response can become more normative it may influence attitudes and behavior towards women in STEM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study aimed to design a preliminary implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to measure the increased complexity and the flexibility in perspective taking (PT). Undergraduate students (N = 35) from a Spanish university completed a PT scale and a PT task (deictic relational task; DRT) that involved trials with different complexity (reversed and double reversed). Then, participants were asked to complete an IRAP to assess the level of complexity and flexibility involved in perspective-taking framing. Results showed that the IRAP captured the differences, on the one hand, in relational complexity when the participants were asked to respond saying Yes or No to their own perspective and, on the other hand, in relational flexibility when they were asked to change their own perspective. In addition, the IRAP effect correlated with high deictic ability as measured by the DRT (mainly in double-reversed trials). These findings suggest that the IRAP as designed in the present study seems to be a good indicator of complexity and flexibility in PT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Bortoloti, Renato

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Bortoloti and de Rose (2009) found evidence that the level of functional transfer is higher in equivalence classes generated by delayed matching to sample (DMTS) than in classes generated by simultaneous matching (SMTS). We attempted to replicate these findings with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Two experimental groups established two equivalence classes, each comprised of faces expressing either anger or happiness and nonsense words. The classes were established with SMTS for one group and with DMTS for the other. Then, nonsense words and the faces were respectively presented as 'attribute' and target stimuli in IRAP tasks. The DMTS group yielded the expected IRAP effect; the SMTS group yielded an IRAP effect only when the target was a happy face. It is discussed that DMTS can enhance transfer of 'semantic' functions between equivalent stimuli, supporting the idea that the relatedness of stimuli can vary as a function of experimental parameters.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study examined the use of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of spider fear, approach, and avoidance. Participants were drawn from a normative sample of university undergraduates. Experiment 1 employed two IRAPs, one targeting spider fear, the other targeting spider approach/avoidance. The Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) and a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) using a spider moult were also employed. Negative response biases for spider fear and avoidance, but not for approach, were recorded. The bias for fear was significantly stronger than for avoidance and approach. Both IRAP’s failed to provide evidence for the predicative validity of the IRAP in terms of the BAT. Experiment 2 was a partial replication of Experiment 1 but using a live house spider instead of a moult for the BAT. A similar pattern of results was obtained across the two IRAPs, but one specific trial-type (Spider-Approach) predicted approach responses on the BAT. The research, thus, replicated a previously published study by Nicholson and Barnes-Holmes (2012), thus supporting the predictive validity of the IRAP but at a level of precision not provided in the earlier study. Implications for applied research are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study reports the findings of an experiment in which adolescents’ explicit and implicit attitudes toward cyberbullying were explored. Participants first completed an explicit measure of their attitudes toward cyberbullying, followed by an implicit measure in the form of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results revealed that participants displayed a combination of anti- and pro-cyberbullying attitudes. There was no statistically significant correlation between participants’ implicit and explicit attitudes toward cyberbullying. The current findings may have important implications for our understanding of adolescents’ attitudes toward cyberbullying and the development of relevant educational programs.

AU  - Bast, Diana Ferroni
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Yvonne
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to test the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of self-forgiveness response biases related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in everyday life. Unlike previous IRAPs, the stimuli were individualized in that they were based on 'problematic' and 'non-problematic' behaviors (e.g., procrastination vs. keeping deadlines) that each participant reported at the beginning of the study. Method: Specifically, participants completed two IRAPs. One (the Feelings IRAP) targeted negative and positive feelings experienced while engaging in problematic versus nonproblematic behavior. The other (the Outcomes IRAP) targeted positive and negative outcomes believed to result from this behavior. Participants also completed standardized measures of psychological suffering and self-compassion as well as a questionnaire that targeted the behavior and reactions presented in the IRAPs. Results: While both IRAPs produced response biases that indicated that positive feelings and outcomes were related to nonproblematic behavior, neither produced clear evidence that negative feelings or outcomes were related to problematic behavior. Furthermore, specific response biases on the IRAP (i.e., a tendency to confirm that negative actions lead to negative outcomes) correlated with psychological suffering, particularly depression and stress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that individualized IRAPs, even those that target minor problematic behavior, may be predictive of psychological suffering.

T2  - Psychological Assessment
AB  - How can implicit attitudes best be measured? The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), unlike the Implicit Association Test (IAT), claims to measure absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes. In the IRAP, participants make congruent (Fat Person-Active: false; Fat Person-Unhealthy: true) or incongruent (Fat Person-Active: true; Fat Person-Unhealthy: false) responses in different blocks of trials. IRAP experiments have reported positive or neutral implicit attitudes (e.g., neutral attitudes toward fat people) in cases in which negative attitudes are normally found on explicit or other implicit measures. It was hypothesized that these results might reflect a positive framing bias (PFB) that occurs when participants complete the IRAP. Implicit attitudes toward categories with varying prior associations (nonwords, social systems, flowers and insects, thin and fat people) were measured. Three conditions (standard, positive framing, and negative framing) were used to measure whether framing influenced estimates of implicit attitudes. It was found that IRAP scores were influenced by how the task was framed to the participants, that the framing effect was modulated by the strength of prior stimulus associations, and that a default PFB led to an overestimation of positive implicit attitudes when measured by the IRAP. Overall, the findings question the validity of the IRAP as a tool for the measurement of absolute implicit attitudes. A new tool (Simple Implicit Procedure:SIP) for measuring absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study aimed to develop the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of response biases related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in the context of minor failings and successes in everyday life. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Sixty undergraduates completed two IRAPs and the explicit measures. The pattern of biases observed across the implicit and explicit measures diverged, and the correlations between the two types of measures were either absent or relatively weak. The results suggest that implicit measures may provide an additional source of information concerning self-forgiveness beyond that provided by explicit self-report measures per se.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Under the rubric of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), researchers have investigated the role of deictic relational responding in the analysis of self in relation to others, place, and time, primarily through the use of an extended developmental protocol (Barnes-Holmes, 2001). In a move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological Record, 66, 243–252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to self was involved, only responding to others. The results from Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the read-aloud procedure.

AB  - The current research comprised two studies that explored the utility of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of children's implicit attitudes to the self. Study 1 (N = 20) involved a sample of children with ADHD and typically-developing children, all aged between 8 and 11 years. Across IRAP trials, each child's own name (e.g., MARY) was juxtaposed with a common name of the opposite gender (e.g., PETER), and presented in conjunction with three positive or three negative words and the two relational terms SIMILAR and OPPOSITE. The results indicated that both groups of children showed an implicit pro-self bias in trial-types denoted as Self-Positive and Self-Negative. While the typically-developing children were neither positive nor negative towards the other gender, the children with ADHD showed a pro-other bias in the Other-Negative trial-type. Study < 2 (N = 20) involved typically-developing children and children with dyslexia, all aged between 9 and 14 years. Again, both groups showed a pro-self bias in the Self-Positive and Self-Negative trial-types, and both were neither positive nor negative in the Other-Positive trial-type. However, the typically-developing children were anti-others in the Other-Negative trial-type, while the children with dyslexia were pro-others. The study highlights the benefits of using both explicit and implicit measures, especially the IRAP, when assessing the implicit cognitions of children.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc explanation provided in a previously published article, the first experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved in producing IRAP effects—the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model—which is presented in the General Discussion.

We asked whether combining the labels and targets into a single phrase would influence performances. The key purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility of altering the way in which stimuli are presented within the IRAP, so as to potentially employ more complex natural language-like statements in future research. In the Typical IRAP employed here, labels and targets were presented as separate words, while in the Natural Language IRAP they were combined to form a single statement. The results demonstrated no substantive differences in the effects recorded on both types of IRAP, thus supporting the future use of a Natural Language version.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used to assess the probability of arbitrarily applicable relational responding or as an indirect measure of implicit attitudes. To date, IRAP effects have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semiparametric measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement, & Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models, in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to test the effect of positive and negative priming on the assessment of self-forgiveness in the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in everyday life. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Method: Eighty-one undergraduates were assigned in 2 groups, where they were presented with different conditions, positive and negative priming, in which participants had to recall in writing three experiences of failing or succeeding; participants then completed 2 IRAPs, 1 targeting feelings and the other targeting outcomes as related to failing and succeeding behaviors. In addition, participants were asked to complete 2 explicit measures that were derived from the 2 IRAPs and another 2 explicit measures that targeted self-compassion and stress, anxiety, and depression. Results: The findings showed that the priming conditions affected the 2 IRAPs differentially. Furthermore, the IRAP that targeted feelings predicted level of self-reported psychopathology but only for participants in the positive priming condition. The findings are discussed in the context of providing tentative evidence for experiential avoidance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - This was the first study that aimed to examine the effects of instructing participants to 'fake' their performance on the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Thirty-six participants were first exposed to an IRAP. Consistent blocks involved responding to pleasant target words as pleasant, and unpleasant words as unpleasant; inconsistent blocks involved the opposite response pattern. As predicted, latencies were significantly shorter on consistent relative to inconsistent blocks. Subsequently, all participants were informed about how the IRAP works; 12 participants were also asked to try to fake the next IRAP by thinking of pleasant things as unpleasant and unpleasant things as pleasant; and another 12 were also told how to fake the IRAP (slow down on consistent trials). Results showed no evidence of faking, which contrasts with previous research in which the Implicit Association Test (IAT) was successfully faked.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current research aimed to examine the implicit biases of smokers and nonsmokers to others who did or did not smoke. Study 1 presented adult smokers and nonsmokers with an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that assessed bias toward or against smokers and nonsmokers. Study 2 replicated this with adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Both studies also presented self-report measures. Both adult and adolescent smokers produced IRAP effects that indicated prosmoker biases; nonsmokers’ biases were relatively neutral. Trends in the data from Studies 1 and 2 led to a post hoc analysis of the nonsmoker data to investigate the potential impact of parental smoking status on nonsmokers’ biases. Both the IRAP and self-report measures data suggested that parental smoking status increased positivity in attitudes toward smokers among nonsmokers. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that the IRAP data in Study 1, but not Study 2, predicted smoking status above and beyond the self-report measures. The post hoc analyses showed a similar trend. The consistency of the findings with the only existing IRAP study of attitudes toward smokers, as well as with the broader literature, supports the view that response biases toward smokers may not change fundamentally from adolescence to adulthood, and that parental smoking status may having a moderating influence on these biases.

AB  - A greater understanding of implicit cognition can provide important information regarding the etiology and maintenance of psychological disorders. The current study sought to determine the utility of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of implicit aversive bias toward spiders in two groups of known variation, high fear and low fear. The study also endeavored to ascertain the predictive validity of the IRAP in terms of real-life behavior by means of a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT). Results demonstrated that the IRAP can differentiate between two groups with known differences in relation to spider fear. Furthermore, these distinctions act as predictors for overt avoidance behavior with a live spider. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study examined racial bias among White individuals residing in Ireland using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In addition, neural activity, measured with electroencephalograms (EEGs), was recorded while participants completed the IRAP. On some blocks of trials, participants were required to respond quickly and accurately in a pro-White and anti-Black manner, whereas on other blocks they were required to respond in the opposite manner (anti-White or pro-Black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias, and event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from the EEG signals, provided a simultaneous measure of brain activity during these responses. Results revealed anti-Black and pro-White biased responding on the IRAP in terms of differential response latencies. In addition, greater positivity in the ERP signals located in the frontal sites was recorded when participants responded in a pro-Black or anti-White pattern relative to a pro-White or anti-Black pattern. These results are broadly consistent with those of previous literature in the area and suggest that the IRAP is a potentially useful methodology for research in the field of affective neuroscience.

AU  - Hughes, Sean
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Research increasingly supports the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure capable of providing a sensitive index of preexisting implicit attitudes and cognitions. The current study constitutes the first attempt to determine if the IRAP is also sensitive to implicit attitudes engineered through either direct relational training or verbal instruction. Following attitude-induction training, participants completed an IRAP in addition to two self-report procedures designed to measure newly formed attitudes. Both implicit and explicit attitudes emerged and persisted in response to both relational training and verbal instruction. Furthermore, the IRAP data indicated significant implicit attitudes when participants both affirmed attitude-consistent and negated attitude-inconsistent relations. The findings are consistent with previous attitude-formation research, but the relational properties of the IRAP raise specific conceptual issues pertaining to the nature of implicit attitudes themselves.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a relatively new method for studying attitudes and beliefs. The current IRAP assessed women's stereotypes about gay and straight men. Results confirmed significant stereotypes about traits of both groups, and revealed that participants denied that either group displayed traits associated with the other group. Stereotypes confirming traits were stronger than stereotypes denying traits. The current study also manipulated cognitive resources by administering surveys before or after the IRAP; and by having participants drink either a regular or sugar-free beverage. Surveys were more sensitive to resource availability than the IRAP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study attempted to systematically manipulate stimulus presentations in the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to determine the potential impact of this variable on implicit responding. The study comprised of four conditions that systematically manipulated the positions of the sample stimuli and the response options. Specifically, the Random-Random Condition randomized both sample stimuli and response options; Random-Fixed randomized sample stimuli, but response options remained in fixed locations; Fixed-Random Condition fixed sample stimuli but randomized response options; and Fixed-Fixed Condition fixed both sample stimuli and response options. The results demonstrated strong and predicted IRAP effects in all four conditions. Although the Random-Fixed presentation generated the strongest D-IRAP score, the randomization of the sample stimuli and response options were both critical to producing strong and significant D-IRAP scores because the Random-Random and Fixed-Random Conditions were only marginally smaller. The implications of the findings for existing and future research with the IRAP are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14(1) of International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy (see record [rid]2014-13028-010[/rid]). In the original article Figure 2 on page 463 contained several mistakes. The correct figure is present in the erratum.] This preliminary study is the first to illustrate the conceptual rationale for, and methodological potential of, an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure designed to measure adolescents' smoking-related social identity preferences (SIP-IRAP). Even with a small sample comprising of eight adolescent smokers and eight nonsmokers, the IRAP data tentatively suggested that adolescent smokers have a tendency to relate the sample word 'Smoker' as 'Similar' to social acceptance words, but adolescent nonsmokers do not. The IRAP further distinguished smokers from nonsmokers by their tendency to relate 'Nonsmoker' as 'Similar' to social rejection words. The current study, in its presentation of an uncomplicated 'preparation-IRAP' for participants to rehearse before taking the SIP-IRAP, constitutes the earliest attempt to optimise participant performance on the original IRAP methodology. Given that the raison d' etre of the IRAP is to continually optimise experimental control over the measurement of verbal biases, we use the current study as a basis for explicating the chronology and evolving rationale for subsequent evolutions of the IRAP methodology currently entering the literature. A central aim of our account is to use IRAP first principles to collate and interpret such recent optimisations of the IRAP methodology, in order to recommend how best to use the IRAP in future investigations probing the verbal networks of adolescent smokers. The current preliminary study particularly emphasized the importance for optimising the precision of the IRAP, of using adjunctive participant preparation procedures. The current paper suggests how with optimizations, the IRAP is likely to provide additional predictive utility over self-report measures for adolescents, particularly when applied to relatively stigmatized or impulsive behaviours.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was designed to examine implicit beliefs or attitudes. In Experiment 1, response latencies obtained from Irish participants on the IRAP showed a strong preference for Irish over Scottish and American over African. In contrast, responses to explicit Likert measures diverged from the IRAP performance in indicating Irish equally likeable to Scottish and African more likeable than American. Using a similar IRAP, Experiment 2 showed that participants from the United States showed strong implicit preferences for American over Irish, Irish over Scottish, and Scottish over African; the explicit Likert measures again diverged from the IRAP. The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a useful measure of implicit beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study examined the malleability of implicit attitudes using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In Experiment 1, 'similar' and 'opposite' were presented as response options with the sample terms 'old people' and 'young people' and various positive and negative target stimuli. Results showed significantly faster response latencies for consistent (e.g., Similar-Positive-Young People) compared to inconsistent tasks (e.g., Similar-Positive-Old People). Explicit measures did not correlate with this IRAP effect. Experiment 2 determined whether prior exposure to pictures of admired and disliked old and young individuals had an impact on IRAP performance. Results revealed that pro-old exemplars reduced the pro-young IRAP effect, but reversed the anti-old effect, and this held for 24 h; explicit measures were largely unaffected. The findings suggest that the IRAP provides an informative measure of attitude-change following pro- versus anti-exemplar training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current professional interest brief aims to outline the feasibility of using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in a pilot study of individuals who heard voices and of whom the majority had been given a diagnosis of psychosis, and a comparison sample of non-voice hearing controls against which the clinical data could be compared (clinical voice hearers, N = 9; controls, N = 9). The IRAP assessed acceptance and avoidance of positively versus negatively valenced voices. All clinical participants completed the IRAP in terms of reaching the standard accuracy and latency criteria, thus demonstrating that a clinical (specifically psychosis) sample can complete content-specific IRAPs. Indeed, some procedural modifications were required and these have been outlined in the current manuscript. Preliminary results at both the group and individual levels appear to be in a meaningful direction for the psychosis sample, but not for the controls, which was consistent with our predictions. Our preliminary data support the view that the IRAP may be used effectively with a resident in-patient population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current article reports the first attempt to test the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as a group-based measure of natural verbal relations, using both response-latency and event-related potentials as dependent variables. On each trial of the IRAP, participants were presented with I of 2 attribute stimuli ('Pleasant' or 'Unpleasant'), a positive (e.g., 'Love') or negative (e.g., 'Murder') target stimulus, and 2 relational terms, 'Similar' and 'Opposite,' as response options. Participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible across blocks of trials, with half of the blocks requiring responses that were deemed consistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Similar), and the other half inconsistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Opposite), with natural verbal relations. Shorter mean latencies were predicted for consistent than for inconsistent blocks. Two separate experiments supported this prediction. Event-related potentials, gathered during the second experiment, also proved to be sensitive to the IRAP, yielding more negative waveforms for inconsistent relative to consistent blocks of trials. A theoretical interpretation of the IRAP effect is offered, and important directions for future research are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was utilized as a means of interpreting disgust in terms of the six domains of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as defined by the Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group; excessive responsibility, overestimation of threat, perfectionism, intolerance for uncertainty, over importance of thoughts and need to control thoughts. A non-clinical sample (N=44 undergraduate students) completed an IRAP designed to assess appraisals of disgust-inducing pictorial stimuli based on the six belief domains at the implicit level. A series of self-report measures including the Obsessive-Beliefs Questionnaire, the Padua Inventory and the STAI were also implemented. Results indicated that a greater bias toward appraising disgusting stimuli as being negative was related to excessive responsibility and overestimation of threat along with perfectionism and intolerance for uncertainty. Critically, these effects were found to be independent of anxiety supporting the influence of disgust responding in the etiology of OC tendencies.

AB  - Sugar ingestion bolsters cognitive resources, which should improve ability to inhibit expressing socially undesirable responses on explicit measures, including surveys. In this study, undergraduates drank regular or diet root-beer, then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) followed by an Anti-Muslim Prejudice Scale (AMPS). The IRAP indicated neutral attitudes about Muslims and positive attitudes about Westerners. However, the AMPS indicated significant pro-Muslim attitudes. There was no significant effect of drink on the AMPS. However, participants who drank regular root-beer showed stronger anti-Muslim bias on the IRAP. Increased bias following sugar ingestion may reflect a discrepancy between implicit and explicit measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is frequently employed over other measures of so-called implicit attitudes because it produces 4 independent and 'nonrelative' bias scores, thereby providing greater clarity around what drives an effect. Indeed, studies have sometimes emphasized the procedural separation of the four trial types by choosing to report only the results of a single, theoretically meaningful trial type. However, no research to date has examined the degree to which performance on a given trial type is impacted upon by other stimulus categories employed within the task. The current study examined the extent to which response biases toward 'women' are influenced by two different contrast categories: 'men' versus 'inanimate objects.' Results indicated that greater dehumanization of women was observed in the context of the latter relative to the former category. The findings highlight that the IRAP may be described as a nonrelative, but not acontextual, measure of brief and immediate relational responses.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The social construction of gender-as-binary plays an important role within many contemporary theories of gender inequality. However, to date, the field of psychology has struggled with the operationalization and assessment of binarist ideologies. The current article proposes a technical framework for the analysis of the gender binary and assesses the suitability of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of binarist gender beliefs. Forty-seven undergraduate students (26 female; Mage = 23.84) completed two IRAPs assessing the coordination of certain traits exclusively with women and others exclusively with men. Effects found on the IRAP were in the expected direction (i.e., relating men but not women with certain traits and women but not men with other traits). In addition, the traits ascribed to men within the IRAP were evaluated as more hirable by a large majority of participants (83%) on an explicit preference task. The results therefore support the arguments that, first, gender traits do seem to be framed oppositionally in language and, second, this binary may underpin existing gender hierarchies in certain contexts.

TI  - An examination of generalised implicit biases towards ‘wanting more’ as a proxy measure of materialistic behaviour: A relational frame theory ((RFT) perspective
AU  - Pennie, Brian
AU  - Kelly, Michelle E.
T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The research investigated the contextual effects of mood on implicit measures of ‘wanting more’ as a proxy of materialism and investigated the basic verbal processes underpinning this behaviour. Sixty university students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n = 19) mood induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS), materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP, shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad) compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were interpreted as an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’. Compared to the neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition demonstrated an increased bias towards ‘wanting less’ (p = .028). Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with an implicit bias towards ‘wanting more’ (rs 's ranging from−.455 to −.565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards wanting less (rs = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of ‘wanting more’ as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Finn, Martin

AU  - Graddy, Joseph
T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is increasingly used in applied and clinical settings, and yet many of the procedural variables of the measure have not been subjected to a systematic analysis. One such variable is the type of rules that are employed when instructing the IRAP and the effect this might have on participants’ performances. In the current article, three experiments were used to assess the impact of three different types of rules or instructions on IRAP performance. The instructions varied in the degree to which they specified parts of the relational network being assessed by the IRAP. The findings showed that the type of rule presented to participants during an IRAP can have a dramatic effect on the strength and direction of the trial-type effects that are produced by the measure. Furthermore, the type of instructions employed appear to interact with the order in which the IRAP blocks are presented (history-consistent versus history-inconsistent). The findings indicate that the behavioural dynamics that occur when participants complete an IRAP require extensive and systematic experimental and conceptual analyses, and this work will likely have an important bearing on research seeking to investigate the predictive validity of the IRAP in applied research settings.

AB  - The current study aimed to test the effect of behavior therapy training on the assessment of self-forgiveness, focusing on the feelings or outcomes that may be associated with failing and succeeding in everyday life, using 2 Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) that had been developed across a series of previously published studies. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which responding on the IRAP correlated with standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Forty undergraduate and postgraduate students completed the study (20 individuals who were teaching on, attending, or who had attended a course in clinical behavior analysis and 20 students from different fields). The two groups (behavior therapists and nontherapists) completed the 2 IRAPs and the explicit measures. Overall, only 1 of the 2 IRAPs, the one that targeted feelings rather than outcomes, produced clear and significant differences between the behavior therapist and nontherapist groups. This result indicated that the diverging performances were specific to the stimuli that were presented in the IRAP rather than reflecting a generic between-group difference produced by the measure itself. Furthermore, both IRAPs predicted levels of self-reported psychopathology and self-compassion. A number of potential reasons why this pattern of results emerged using the 2 IRAPs and explicit measures with these 2 groups of participants are considered.

AU  - Drake, Chad E.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Although multiple studies have demonstrated that the Implicit Association Test (IAT) can be successfully faked, a single study using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP; McKenna, Barnes-Holmes, Barnes-Holmes, & Stewart, International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy, 7(2): 253–268, 2007) concluded that this behavior-analytic alternative to implicit measures may be relatively immune to faking. The current study examined the fakability of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an opportunity to examine split-half and test–retest reliability, an underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test–retest correlations; the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a significant test–retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but also the reliability of the measure. Future research might focus on methods of detecting and/or preventing faking of the procedure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study was conducted to validate an adaptation of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an indirect latency-based measure of sexual orientation. Furthermore, reliability and criterion validity of the IRAP were compared to two established indirect measures of sexual orientation: a Choice Reaction Time task (CRT) and a Viewing Time (VT) task. A sample of 87 heterosexual and 35 gay men completed all three indirect measures in an online study. The IRAP and the VT predicted sexual orientation nearly perfectly. Both measures also showed a considerable amount of convergent validity. Reliabilities (internal consistencies) reached satisfactory levels. In contrast, the CRT did not tap into sexual orientation in the present study. In sum, the VT measure performed best, with the IRAP showing only slightly lower reliability and criterion validity, whereas the CRT did not yield any evidence of reliability or criterion validity in the present research. The results were discussed in the light of specific task properties of the indirect latency-based measures (task-relevance vs. task-irrelevance).

AU  - Expósito, Paloma Maroto
AU  - López, Mónica Hernández
AU  - Valverde, Miguel Rodríguez
T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - Research on implicit attitudes to both male and female body size has produced evidence for the existence of an attitudinal bias in the form of preference for images of thinness over images of fatness. Specifically, studies that have employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) have shown that this bias is specifically attributable to a pro-slim attitude, rather than to an anti-fat one. It is not clear, however, if the same type of specific pro-slim bias will be found when attitudes are measured exclusively for female participants and only to female targets. The present study has employed the IRAP for the assessment of implicit attitudes towards fatness and slimness in a sample of 40 Spanish young female college students. The task required participants to respond relationally in alternating trial-blocks. In pro-slim/anti-fat blocks, they had to respond as if photos of underweight women were pleasant and photos of overweight women were unpleasant. In anti-fat/pro-slim blocks they had to respond according to the opposite pattern (overweight as pleasant and underweight as unpleasant). Additionally, participants had to produce explicit ratings of pleasantness for the same photos used in the IRAP (with a visual analogue scale: VAS), and answer measures of body dissatisfaction (the Body Shape Questionnaire: BSQ) and of eating disorders symptomatology (the Eating Attitudes Test: EAT-40). Results showed no evidence of implicit bias for body size (neither pro-slim nor anti-fat). Besides, no significant correlations were found between implicit and explicit measures. These results are consistent with prior evidence suggesting that women show less anti-fat prejudice than men, and with studies that find less anti-fat bias in Spanish population than in Anglo-Saxon population.

AB  - Mainstream implicit cognition measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) have produced a substantial volume of data on political attitudes. However, the associative basis of most implicit measures entail interpretive limitations that may be avoided with a relatively new measure known as the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The IRAP is a measure of arbitrarily applicable relational repertoires based on a functional and contextual view of cognition. The current study used the IRAP to assess relational repertoires among college undergraduates in respect to images of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney presented in conjunction with positive and negative evaluative words. The results showed distinct patterns of bias on the IRAP that correlated with various political self-reports. The IRAP also distinguished self-reported intentions to vote for Obama or Romney. Some of the results revealed patterns that would not be apparent with a comparable IAT. The current study provides a supportive basis for the reliability and convergent validity of the IRAP for measuring implicit perceptions of political candidates.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used for assessing implicit attitudes across different domains. The current study aimed to investigate whether the IRAP is an adequate measure to assess children’s implicit gender-based attitudes toward toys (dolls and toy cars). Although the software parameters used were taken from previous adult studies, children performed successfully in the task. The strongest IRAP effect found was for relations between dolls and girls (i.e., participants responded faster when relating dolls-girls-match than dolls-boys-match). Additionally, children’s response latencies were longer for pairings of dolls and boys than for pairings of toy cars and girls. These findings seem to confirm that the IRAP is sensitive to gender-stereotyped relations established in children and may be a useful tool in providing additional information to complement explicit measures in children’s attitudes.

T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - The behaviorally-based Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used for the first time in the area of attractiveness bias with adult participants (N = 41). Alternate IRAP trial-blocks required participants to affirm relations consistent (attractive-successful) and inconsistent (unattractive-successful) with attractiveness bias; shorter mean response latencies (faster responding) across consistent trial-blocks were interpreted in terms of implicit stereotype. Participants also completed a Likert-type scale rating of the successfulness of attractive versus unattractive individuals. Statistical analyses were conducted with implicit and explicit data, and both indicated attractiveness bias for male and female participants. Directionality of implicit bias was analyzed via the IRAP 4 trial-type methodology to determine if bias was pro-attractive or anti-unattractive, or if it was evident in both directions; a statistically significant implicit proattractive and antiunattractive bias was shown for male and female participants, and the effect was greater for male participants. Modest correlations were found between implicit and explicit data. Findings are discussed regarding a comprehensive and nuanced account of attractiveness bias, directionality, and contextual influences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Exploring the behavioral dynamics of the implicit relational assessment procedure: The role of relational contextual cues versus relational coherence indicators as response options
AU  - Maloney, Emma
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study examined the role of relational contextual cues (Crels) versus relational coherence indicators (RCIs) as response options in the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). Fifty-two university undergraduate participants successfully completed two consecutive IRAPs. Both IRAPs were similar except for the response options employed. The Crels similar and different served as response options for one IRAP with the RCIs true and false as response options for the other. The order in which the two different IRAPs were completed was counterbalanced across participants. Although the two types of response options yielded similar effects for the participants’ first exposures to the IRAPs, differences emerged during the second exposures. In addition, one of the four trial types from the IRAP appeared to be particularly sensitive to the Crel–RCI manipulation and the order in which the two types of IRAP blocks were presented (consistent-first versus inconsistent-first with natural verbal relations). The findings highlight the complex behavioral dynamics that may be involved in IRAP performances and suggest that even seemingly trivial components of the procedure require systematic analysis.

AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The current study tested the validity of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a tool for clinical assessment. Twenty-four students with high social anxiety were randomly assigned to either cognitive defusion or control conditions. Participants completed a self-report measure of the believability of anxiety-related thoughts and the Anxiety IRAP before and after the interventions. Significant decreases in response latency on the IRAP for both consistent and inconsistent trials were found only in participants in the cognitive defusion condition. We suggest that narrow and inflexible responding (i.e., fusion) interferes with behavioral fluency in both consistent and inconsistent blocks of the implicit measure, and thus a defusion intervention reduced response latencies in both types of blocks. In the control condition, however, we found a reduction in response latencies only for the inconsistent blocks, due to practice that occurred in the absence of a floor effect. The self-report believability measure, which produced effects for both the defusion and control conditions, showed a larger effect size for the control condition. Our results suggest that future studies that seek to analyze the impact of defusion interventions, and the psychological processes involved, employ a range of measures such as the IRAP, with a particular focus on separating out the effects of the therapeutic intervention from possible practice effects.

AU  - Bast, Diana Ferroni
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study was largely exploratory and sought to begin the development of a measure of implicit forgiveness of self related to 'minor' transgressions (mistakes, flaws, shortcomings) versus the forgiveness of others. Forty-seven students completed a scale designed to measure forgiveness of self and others using the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). The results indicated that the measure of implicit forgiveness diverged from an explicit measure designed to measure the same construct. The key finding was that participants tended to be more forgiving toward themselves than toward others at an implicit level, but on an explicit measure, participants rated their own failures as less acceptable than the failures of others. Overall, the findings suggest that it may be useful to supplement explicit measures of forgiveness with implicit measures in future research.

AB  - The current study aimed to test the validity of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as compared to the Implicit Association Test (IAT), by assessing the attitudes of Dublin dwellers and rural dwellers toward Dublin and country life. Discrimination between the two groups for the IAT was marginally significant. The IRAP discriminated significantly between the two groups based on an interaction effect, which showed that rural dwellers had a strong bias toward country life but Dublin dwellers did not show the same bias toward Dublin life. The IRAP data correlated moderately with the explicit measures, but the IAT did not. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially useful measure of implicit attitudes.

TI  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit depression and the role of psychological flexibility
AU  - Hussey, Ian
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - Cognitive and Behavioral Practice
AB  - A broad implicit measure of depressive emotional reactions was created by mapping the content of the depression scale from the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) on to the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were asked to relate pairings of antecedents and emotional reactions that followed the formula 'When X happens … I feel Y.' Groups of participants representing the low and high extremes of normative levels of depressive symptoms completed an IRAP before and after a sad mood–induction procedure. At baseline both groups produced a positive emotional response bias on the IRAP. After the sad mood induction, the 'normal' group showed no change, whereas the 'mild/moderate' depression group showed a significant decrease in the positivity of their emotional responses. A similar pattern of differential change was found when groups were created using scores on the AAQ-II. The findings are related to the broader literature on cognitive reactivity and implications for future research are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Across four studies, we demonstrate that effects obtained from the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, like those obtained from other indirect procedures, are not impervious to strategic manipulation. In experiment 1, we found that merely informing participants to 'fake' their performance without providing a concrete strategy to do so did not eliminate, reverse, or in any way alter the obtained outcomes. However, when those same instructions orientated attention toward the core parameters of the task, participants spontaneously derived a strategy that allowed them to eliminate their effects (experiment 2). When the participants were provided with a viable response strategy, they successfully reversed the direction of their overall Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure effect (experiment 3). By refining the nature of those instructions, we managed to target and alter individual trial‐type effects in isolation with some success (experiment 4).

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and explicit measures were used with 21 college students to determine if body weight of target stimuli (photographic images of slim and overweight individuals) influenced perceptions of intelligence. The explicit measure was a computerized adaptation of the Anti-Fat Attitudes Questionnaire designed to reduce participant error. A Covert Perception Task was developed as an additional explicit measure in which participants rated the likelihood of success of slim and overweight job applicants. Correlational analyses were used to determine if disparity between current and idealized body mass index (BMI) influenced responding. Statistical analyses were applied to data to determine influence exerted by the gender of participants and/or by the gender of the portrayed target stimuli. Findings are discussed in relation to pro-slim versus anti-fat bias and gender differences in body-weight bias related to participants and targets.

AU  - Farrell, Lynn

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Previous research indicates that educational courses and occupations tend to become associated with one gender more than another. This can be seen within the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) in particular, with men often more strongly associated with these areas than women. Even when individuals claim to hold gender-neutral beliefs about STEM, research has found they may still hold implicit beliefs that are gender-biased. Two implicit measures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared to assess attitudes towards women and science-based versus liberal arts college subjects. The results of the IAT suggested a tendency to associate ‘men’ rather than ‘women’ with ‘science’ for both male and female participants. The IRAP produced a more complex pattern of results, with females showing a tendency to pair men with science and with liberal arts, whereas the males showed a more neutral effect. The findings have implications for those concerned with addressing the gender imbalance in STEM careers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - It has been argued that obese individuals evaluate high caloric, palatable foods more positively than their normal weight peers, and that this positivity bias causes them to consume such foods, even when healthy alternatives are available. Yet when self-reported and automatic food preferences are assessed no such evaluative biases tend to emerge. We argue that situational (food deprivation) and methodological factors may explain why implicit measures often fail to discriminate between the food-evaluations of these two groups. Across three studies we manipulated the food deprivation state of clinically obese and normal-weight participants and then exposed them to an indirect procedure (IRAP) and self-report questionnaires. We found that automatic food-related cognition was moderated by a person's weight status and food deprivation state. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic and predictive value of implicit measures may be increased when (a) situational moderators are taken into consideration and (b) we pay greater attention to the different ways in which people automatically relate rather than simply categorize food stimuli.

AB  - The present study examined participants’ implicit and explicit attitudes toward mainstream and BDSM (bondage and discipline/dominance and submission/sadism and masochism) sexual terms using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and several questionnaires and investigated the relationship between scores on these measures and participant behavior toward a BDSM-labeled and a non-BDSM-labeled confederate during an interviewing task. Twenty-one participants, who were either graduate psychology students or practicing clinicians, completed the study. Results were consistent with previous research (Stockwell, Walker, & Eshleman, The Psychological Record, 60(2), 307–324, 2010) in that responses on both the IRAP and Visual Analogue Scales showed an acceptance of mainstream sexual terms and unfavorable responding to BDSM terms; in contrast, Likert-scale questionnaire responses generally reflected favorable attitudes toward people who practice BDSM. IRAP scores were positively correlated with differences in smiling across the two interview conditions; that is, participants with anti-BDSM responding on the IRAP smiled significantly less while interviewing the BDSM-labeled confederate than when they interviewed the non-BDSM confederate. No other differences in interviewing behavior were observed or correlated with IRAP responding, suggesting that implicit attitudes may not be a reliable predictor of participant behavior during interviews of individuals labeled as practicing BDSM.

T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - The study investigated how conflicting stimulus–response mappings influenced affordance processing given a manipulation of the functional relations. Participants performed a task involving consistent–inconsistent stimulus–response mappings: Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). They were instructed to confirm or to deny a relation between words and tool-objects (consistent blocks) or to provide non-conventional responses (inconsistent blocks). The relations between stimuli could functionally match (e.g., Kitchen—Spatula) or not (e.g., Kitchen—Hammer), as well as the spatial relations (e.g., a match or a mismatch between participants’ hand response and the tool-object orientation). The results showed faster reaction times (RTs) when functional relations between stimuli matched both in consistent and inconsistent blocks. Differences in RTs and accuracy between consistent and inconsistent blocks were only found when the functional relation between stimuli matched. No modulation of the performance was observed for mismatching functional relations and spatial relations between blocks. These results support the hypothesis that the responsiveness to affordances is strongly modulated by matching functional relations, despite the impact of conflicting stimulus–response mappings.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Background & Objectives: The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a widely used measure of implicit cognition which has detected biases pertaining to various psychological constructs from spider fear to cocaine dependence. One issue which emerges in the IRAP literature is that of participants failing to meet or uphold the necessary criteria to complete the IRAP, which results in their elimination from the study, which can be rather detrimental to results. The present study sought to delineate which factors may contribute to high attrition rates in IRAP research. Methodology: A previously used IRAP measuring spider fear was employed along with an n-back task and a series of questionnaires. Results: Results indicated that the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and focus attention on the task at hand was the best predictor of accuracy on the IRAP, irrespective of spider fear or current levels of anxiety. Conclusions: These results are promising for the use of the IRAP in clinically-relevant domains as they suggest that the psychopathology of participants does not affect performance on the IRAP.

AB  - The present study examined levels of racial bias among black and white individuals residing in Ireland using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and a range of questionnaire measures. The IRAP required participants to respond quickly and accurately on a computer-based task. On some blocks of trials participants were required to respond in a pro-white and anti-black manner, whereas on other blocks responding in the opposite direction was required (anti-white/pro-black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias. Performance on the IRAP (i) revealed in-group/out-group bias for the white but not the black participants; (ii) substantively increased the predictive validity of a range of questionnaire-based measures; and (iii) provided the best prediction of racial group. The results support the utility of the IRAP as a measure of racial bias, and indicate that this bias differed between black and white Irish residents.

In this study, the IRAP was used to assess implicit attitudes toward 'mainstream' sexual terms (e.g., Kissing) and 'BDSM' terms (e.g., Bondage) among individuals reporting BDSM interests and among students who did not report such interests. A questionnaire was used to measure explicit attitudes toward the same sexual terms as well as self-reported sexual behaviors. Results showed that the Student group generally displayed pro-mainstream attitudes, while the BDSM group displayed pro-BDSM attitudes. These effects were mirrored in the questionnaire results, which provides support for the IRAP as a potentially useful tool in measuring participant attitudes toward complex sexual stimuli.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a relatively new measure of implicit cognition that tests cognition as relational behavior instead of an associative activity and thus may provide a more specific measure of cognitive repertoires, including those for social biases, than better known implicit measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). A small body of IRAP research provides tentative evidence for this measure's potential. The current study adds to this research by using the IRAP to assess for social biases for race, religion, gender, and obesity. Overall results show medium to large effect sizes for all conditions except obesity, as well as interesting trends at the trial-type level. These outcomes and possible future directions of IRAP research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two studies were conducted to pilot the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in measuring attitudes toward the self: one related to body image specifically and another assessing the broader construct of self-esteem. Study 1 utilized the IRAP with female college students to examine self-referential beliefs regarding body image. Results revealed positive associations between self-referential beliefs on the IRAP and explicit measures of body image satisfaction and acceptance, likelihood of dieting, and internalization of the thin ideal. In Study 2, an IRAP measuring general self-esteem revealed positive correlations between IRAP performance and explicit measures of psychological functioning and negative correlations between the IRAP and psychopathology. Results are discussed in terms of the potential utility of this theoretically grounded implicit measure in assessing self-concept. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study aimed to assess the implicit attitudes of vegetarians and non-vegetarians towards meat and vegetables, using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Both measures involved asking participants to respond, under time pressure, to pictures of meat or vegetables as either positive or negative stimuli. Response latency data gathered from both the IAT and the IRAP discriminated at a statistically significant level between vegetarians and meat-eaters. Furthermore, both measures correlated with some features of the explicit self-report measure that was employed in the study. The implicit measures also provided similarly small but statistically significant increases in predictive validity over the explicit measures.

AB  - This study sought to examine the relationship of implicit emotional judgments with experiential avoidance (EA) and social anxiety. A sample of 61 college students completed the Emotional Judgment—Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (EJ-IRAP) as well as a public speaking challenge. Implicit judgments were related to greater self-reported EA, anxiety sensitivity, emotional judgments and social anxiety as well as lower performance ratings and willingness in the public speaking challenge. Effects differed by trial type with 'Anxiety is bad' biases related to greater EA/anxiety, while 'calm is bad' biases related to lower EA/anxiety ('Good' biases were generally unrelated to outcomes). Implicit emotional judgments moderated the relationship of heart rate during the speech with speech time and willingness, such that increases in heart rate were only related to lower speech time and willingness among those high in implicit judgments. Implicit judgments predicted social anxiety above and beyond self-report EA measures. Implicit emotional judgments appear to have a functional role in EA and anxiety that warrants further research.

AB  - Research using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) suggests that a positive bias toward thinness, rather than a negative bias toward fatness, might underlie implicitly assessed evaluative responding regarding body image. Because these results contrast with reports of widespread anti-fat attitudes, we aimed to clarify the nature of implicitly assessed evaluative body image responding by using stimuli more central to body image concerns. Seventy-five undergraduates (65.8 % female) completed two IRAPs to examine three aims: (1) create IRAPs sensitive to histories of self-oriented anti-fat responding by using attractiveness-, fear-, and disgust-based stimulus relations; (2) evaluate responses to the different types of stimulus relations on the IRAPs separately and compare them to each other; and (3) examine correlations among IRAP responding and self-report measures of disgust, fear of fatness, and eating pathology. Results showed that participants demonstrated a self-thin-attractive relational bias. Unexpectedly, respondents also showed a self-fat-attractive relational bias and did not display self-fat-disgusting or self-fat-fear responding. IRAP effects for self-thin-attractive stimulus relations were larger than those for self-fat-attractive stimulus relations, suggesting the pro-self bias on these two trial types was larger when relating to oneself as being thin than when relating to oneself as being overweight. Correlations with self-report measures were nonsignificant. Results are discussed in the context of gaining a better understanding of implicit evaluative body image responding and contextual variables that influence IRAP responding.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Experiential avoidance (EA) is a generalized risk factor for psychopathology and is defined as an unwillingness to remain in contact with private events. A number of behavioral tasks have demonstrated potential in assessing EA, including a limited number of studies using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). IRAP studies of EA to date have involved relatively small samples, limited consideration of dependent variables, and/or stimulus configurations that addressed a conceptually narrow aspect of EA. The current study describes the initial piloting of an IRAP designed to assess implicit repertoires regarding EA and acceptance in response to anxiety-relevant and positive emotional words. A variety of conceptually relevant self-report measures were administered along with the EA IRAP to a sample of college undergraduates. Dependent variables included average latencies for each block type as well as D-scores for each trial type of the IRAP. Evidence for convergent validity was revealed by correlations between the IRAP block-type latencies and a self-report measure of defusion, while unexpected divergent relations were obtained between self-reports and IRAP D-scores. Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated. We discuss alternative approaches to stimulus selection (including response options), increased efforts to reduce attrition, and utilization of clinical samples.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Despite their application in virtually every area of psychological science, indirect procedures have rarely been used to study how Catholic and Protestants automatically respond to one another in Northern Ireland. What little evidence that does exist suggests that automatic ingroup favoritism occurs alongside outgroup derogation. That is, Catholics and Protestants automatically evaluate ingroup members more positively than outgroup members, and also evaluate outgroup members more negatively than ingroup members. The current study addresses a methodological limitation in this early work and provides the first (non-relativistic) assessment of intergroup relational responding in a post-conflict setting using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Contrary to earlier findings, participants displayed evidence of ingroup favoritism in the absence of outgroup derogation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study examined the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure's (IRAP) validity as a computerized response-latency-based measure of implicit self-esteem. University undergraduates and 2 sets of convicted prisoners participated. One set of prisoners resided in the main block, and the other in a privileged lower security 'open area' of a medium-security Irish prison. The IRAP required participants to maintain relational responses that were self-positive on half of the IRAP trials ('Consistent'), and self-negative on the other half ('Inconsistent'). As predicted, the students and the prisoners in the open area showed stronger IRAP effects (shorter latencies during consistent vs. inconsistent trials) than the main block prisoners. Additionally, the IRAP's convergent validity was supported by its moderate positive correlation with an explicit self-esteem measure. The findings provide preliminary support for the analytic utility of the IRAP and suggest future avenues of investigation afforded by the IRAP's design.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current research used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a preliminary step toward bringing a broad, functional approach to understanding psychosis, by focusing on the specific phenomenon of auditory hallucinations of voices and sounds (often referred to as hearing voices). On this path, we created a taxonomy of some critical features of voice hearing based on the existing literature (i.e., perceived normality of voices, appraisals of self and other people hearing voices, and fear of voices) as a focus of our experimental manipulations. It was our hope that our findings would add to the broad literature that has used explicit measures to study these phenomena, and that the use of an ‘implicit’ measure might assist toward a functional analytic understanding. Three pilot studies were conducted to assess the relations within which hearing voices participates in non-clinical voice hearers (i.e., individuals who hear voices but have no clinical diagnosis or distress) and compared to non-voice hearing control participants. The IRAP effects demonstrated both positive and negative relational responses across the three studies, and these effects varied according to explicit levels of delusional ideation. Furthermore, these IRAP effects also predicted explicit aspects of voice hearing and well-being. The current set of pilot studies demonstrate the utility and precision of the IRAP in this domain, and we propose that this type of experimental analysis may hold potential for future bottom-up functional analyses of voice hearing.

AU  - Hussey, I.

AU  - Booth, R.
T2  - Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry
AB  - Background and objectives: Suicidal behaviour has proved to be difficult to predict, due in part to the particular limitations of introspection within suicidality. In an effort to overcome this, recent research has demonstrated the utility of indirect measures of 'implicit' attitudes within the study of suicidality. However, research to date has focused predominantly on implicit self-evaluations and self-death associations. No work has examined implicit evaluations of death, despite the theoretical importance of such evaluations; 'fearlessness of death' is central to both the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicide.. Methods: Twenty-three psychiatric patients with current suicidal ideation and twenty-five normative university students completed two versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that targeted evaluations of death. One task specified personal death (i.e., was self-focused) and the other targeted death in the abstract. Results: Self-focused evaluations of death reliably distinguished between the two groups, correctly classifying 74% of cases, but evaluations of death in the abstract did not. The suicidal group produced specific biases indicating a rejection of the negativity of death. Results are consistent with the definition of suicidality as involving a self-focused wish to die.. Limitations: For ethical reason, suicidal behaviours were not assessed in the normative group. Groups were therefore not mutually exclusive. This may have decreased the specificity of the IRAP. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is associated with an implicit 'fearlessness of death'. The utility of implicit death-evaluations should therefore be considered alongside self-evaluations and self-death associations in the future..

AB  - The current study investigated potential changes in implicit negativity of hearing voices in a non-voice hearing student population (N = 28) subjected to a hearing voices simulation using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). On the Baseline IRAP, participants were required to pair voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative statements on alternating trial blocks. Participants were subsequently exposed to a simulation procedure and a Post-simulation IRAP. At baseline and post-simulation, hearing voices was implicitly evaluated as both positive and fearful, however positivity toward voices reduced and negativity increased after the simulation. Interestingly, implicit changes also appeared to be influenced by high delusional ideation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - American Journal of Psychiatric Rehabilitation
AB  - Research is reported that examines whether imagined social contact combined with implicit attitude feedback may be an effective intervention for inducing changes in attitudes toward mental ill health. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) captured participants’ implicit attitudes toward individuals with a mental illness and provided a measure of attitude bias. Forty-eight participants (17 male, 95.8% White British) were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (1) Imagined social contact with implicit attitude feedback, (2) imagined social contact without feedback, (3) control with feedback, and (4) control without feedback. This resulted in a data set detailing 12,288 implicit responses, with each participant completing 256 IRAP trials. Participants then completed an attitude change assessment 24 hours later. Results revealed that imagined social contact was successful in changing implicit attitudes, with the addition of implicit attitude feedback further strengthening participants’ positive attitudes toward mental ill health. Explicit attitudes remained unaffected. These findings are the first to highlight the practical importance of combining imagined social contact with implicit attitude feedback to improve attitudes toward out-groups who are stigmatized.

AB  - When derived stimulus relations are established, stimulus functions are altered. The present study aimed to verify whether arbitrary symbols related to meaningful stimuli (facial expressions of happiness) would have their meaning transformed in accordance with relations of sameness or opposition. The experiment started with training to establish the meaning of two contextual cues, one for sameness and one for opposition. Then, using these contextual cues, one pair of stimuli was related as same (B1) or opposite (B2) to six photos containing different people expressing happiness (A stimulus set, A1-A6). Following this training, two other stimuli were related as same (C1) and opposite (C2), respectively, to B1. Participants were tested for derived relations and then the transformation of functions from the happy pictures to B1, B2, C1, and C2 was verified using a semantic differential and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from the semantic differential happy/sad scale, taken together with IRAP, indicated the transformation of stimulus functions: Arbitrary stimuli acquired a meaning similar or opposite to the happy faces, according to the trained or derived relations of sameness or opposition.

AB  - Background and objectives: The relationship between self-esteem and paranoia may be influenced by social stress. This study aimed to replicate previous research on the impact of social exclusion on paranoia and self-esteem in a non-clinical sample and to extend this work by examining the effect of exclusion on self-esteem at the ‘implicit’ level. Methods: Non-clinical participants (N = 85) were randomly allocated to the Inclusion or Exclusion condition of a virtual ball-toss game (‘Cyberball’). They completed self-report measures of state paranoia and self-esteem, and two implicit measures of self—Association Task (IAT) and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) –prior to and after exposure to Cyberball. Results: Social exclusion increased state paranoia. This effect was moderated by distress associated with trait paranoia. Exclusion was also associated with decreased self-reported self-esteem, as well as reduced implicit self-esteem on the IAT. Changes in self-reported self-esteem were associated with state paranoia at post-Cyberball. The IRAP indicated that reductions in implicit self-esteem may be due to increases in ‘Me-Negative’ and ‘Others-Positive’ biases (rather than reductions in ‘Me-Positive’ bias). Limitations: The current study involved a non-clinical sample and so findings cannot be generalized to clinical paranoia. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous evidence that paranoia is associated with negative self-evaluations, whereas positive self-evaluations can persist in paranoia. They also provide support for the suggestion that investigations of self-esteem in paranoia should extend beyond global self-esteem and might benefit from a distinction between positive and negative components.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The current study explored implicit attitudes to life and death in a student population using both the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The IAT was similar to one used in previously published researched in the context of the prospective prediction of suicide and self-harm. Two IRAPs were employed, one that assessed relational responses specific to death and life with respect to self, and a second that assessed relational responses specific to evaluations of death and life. The IAT replicated previous results found in normative populations. The IRAPs indicated 'prolife' biases, as expected. However, they also failed to demonstrate the presence of strong 'antideath' biases, and in one case a specific 'death–positive' bias was found. The results observed on the explicit measures did not readily explain the absent or 'prodeath' effects observed on the IRAPs. Indeed, participants reported a normative level of anxiety and fear of death. Implications for the study of implicit attitudes to death using the IRAP are considered.

The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was employed to measure implicit pro-thin and anti-fat attitudes towards Self and Others in addition to 'striving for thinness' and 'avoidance of fatness.' The clinical group showed an implicit pro-fat attitude towards Others and stronger anti-fat attitudes towards Self and avoidance of fatness compared with controls. The findings are discussed in relation to the over-evaluation of weight and shape in the clinical group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current research comprised two experiments that employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of implicit racial attitudes. White Irish participants were exposed to blocks of trials that involved responding in a manner consistent with either a pro-white stereotype or a pro-black stereotype. In Experiment 1, participants completed the IRAP in either a public or private assessment situation. It was hypothesized that implicit pro-white stereotyping would decrease in the public context relative to the private context. The results, however, were not in accordance with this prediction. A second experiment was conducted to determine if requiring participants to respond in a public context but within a shorter timeframe would impact significantly upon implicit stereotyping. The results showed that a reduction in response latency significantly increased ingroup stereotyping. The findings appear to be consistent with the relational elaboration and coherence model.

T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - We examined whether implicit measures of actual and ideal body image can be used to predict body dissatisfaction in young female adults. Participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied with their body. Adding further weight to the idea that both IRAP measures captured different underlying constructs, we also observed that they correlated differently with body mass index, explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate relational information relative to implicit measures that allow for an assessment of associative relations only.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) utilizes cognitive defusion strategies to alter the function of unwanted, distressing thoughts so as to reduce their impact and foster greater psychological flexibility. Though defusion is linked to several positive outcomes (e.g., reduced thought believability, improved pain tolerance), it remains unclear whether such effects are associated with the behavioral process of defusion itself; namely, behavior that is relatively broad and flexible compared with behavior that is narrow and inflexible. To address this issue, the present study assessed the impact of a defusion intervention on behavior, as measured by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Undergraduates high in spider fear (N=65) were randomly assigned to one of two interventions targeting phobic thoughts of spiders: a defusion intervention or a thought distraction intervention. A control condition (reading an article) was used to evaluate the relative impact of both interventions. Participants completed the IRAP and rating scales of believability and distress of target thoughts pre- and post-intervention. Consistent with expectation, defusion produced significantly greater pre- to post-intervention reductions in IRAP effects and thought believability relative to comparison conditions. The practical and scientific implications of the present findings, suggesting that defused behavior is broad and flexible relative to narrow and inflexible, are discussed.

AB  - Researchers have proposed that the cognitive distortions of sexual offenders are underpinned by a number of implicit cognitive processes termed implicit theories. Until recently, however, the implicit theory hypothesis has received little empirical support due to broader limitations with standard forensic assessment procedures. The current research aimed to determine whether a new assessment methodology, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), could provide further evidence for Ward and Keenan’s (1999) children as sexual beings implicit theory. The results indicated that the IRAP was significantly more effective at identifying core implicit differences between sexual offenders against children and nonoffenders than a cognitive distortion questionnaire. Furthermore, although both groups demonstrated an overall response bias towards adults as sexual and children as nonsexual, this bias was significantly impaired in the sexual offender group. The findings are discussed in relation to previous implicit theory research and recommendations for the development of implicit methodologies are made.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most common clinical expressions of the disorder. Irrational beliefs regarding excessive responsibility and the overestimation of threat are common components of OCD; however, there is little research on the relationship between responsibility/threat appraisals and contamination fear. The current study aimed to assess responsibility/threat-type appraisals in relation to contamination and clean stimuli at the implicit level using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). A Behavioral Approach Task and a series of self-report measures assessing general OC tendencies, disgust, psychological inflexibility and general psychopathology were implemented to validate the IRAP. The high OC group produced a significantly greater responsibility/threat bias toward the contamination-related trial-types compared to the low OC group. The contamination-related trial-types were predictive of both self-reported OC tendencies and contamination fear along with avoidance behavior, with the latter two effects being independent of anxiety.

T2  - Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs
AB  - Objective: The current study examined the impact of varying pictorial cues and testing contexts on implicit alcohol-related expectancies. Method: Seventy-six participants were assigned randomly to complete an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in either a pub or lecture context. The IRAP exposed participants to pictorial cues that depicted an alcoholic beverage in the foreground of a pub (alcohol-congruent stimuli) or university lecture theater (alcohol-incongruent stimuli), and participants were required to match both positive and negative alcohol-related outcome expectancies to these stimuli. Corresponding to a 4 × 2 design, IRAP trial types were included in the analysis as repeated-measure variables, whereas testing environment was input as a between-participants variable. Results: Participants more readily endorsed that drinking alcohol was related to positive expectancies when responding to alcohol-congruent stimuli, and this was strengthened when participants completed the task in a pub. Moreover, they more readily confirmed that alcohol was related to negative expectancies when responding to alcohol-incongruent stimuli. Conclusions: These findings suggest that alcohol-related cues and environmental contexts may be a significant driver of positive alcohol-related cognitions, which may have implications for the design of interventions. They emphasize further the importance of examining implicit cognitions in ecologically valid testing contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Timmins, Liam
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
AU  - Cullen, Claire
T2  - Archives of Sexual Behavior
AB  - Snowden, Wichter, and Gray (2008) demonstrated that an Implicit Association Test and a Priming Task both predicted the sexual orientation of gynephilic and androphilic men in terms of their attraction biases towards pictures of nude males and females. For both measures, relative bias scores were obtained, with no information on the separate response biases to each target gender. The present study sought to extend this research by assessing both relative and individual implicit biases using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). An explicit measure screened for men with androphilic (n = 16) or gynephilic (n = 16) orientations on the dimensions of 'sexual attraction,' 'sexual behavior,' 'sexual fantasies,' 'hetero/gay lifestyle,' and 'self identification.' The IRAP involved responding 'True' or 'False' to pictures of nude males and females as either attractive or unattractive. Participants were required to respond in a manner consistent with their reported sexual orientation for half of the IRAP’s test blocks and inconsistent for the other half. Response latencies were recorded and analyzed. The IRAP revealed a non-orthogonal pattern of biases across the two groups and had an excellent ability to predict sexual orientation with areas under the curves of 1.0 for the relative bias score and .94 and .95 for the bias scores for the male and female pictures, respectively. Correlations between the IRAP and explicit measures of sexual orientation were consistently high. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially valuable tool in the study of sexual preferences.

AU  - Pilch, Irena

T2  - Polish Psychological Bulletin
AB  - The results of the previous research which tried to investigate links between self-esteem and narcissism in search of the source of narcissistic fragility are not consistent. The aim of the study was to contribute to the understanding of this complex relation by assessing relationships between the four facets of grandiose narcissism measured by the NPI and the two kinds of self-esteem i.e. explicit (ESE) and implicit (ISE), and by comparing the results with theoretical models. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, a more recent measure based on response latency, was used to assess ISE. The analysis confirms the reports on NPI heterogeneity. Different relationships between the particular facets of narcissism and ESE/ISE were observed. These differences indicate that composite measures of narcissism and ISE do not reflect the entire complexity of the phenomena. The results provide support for the two theoretical models i.e. the global marker model and the mask model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated the impact of reinforcer-focused statements vetted by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) on the intensity of participation in an exercise class. Using a relative heart rate measure, the first experiment compared individually selected phrases focused on the positive consequences of exercise to general topographic advice about how to exercise using an alternating treatments design, and found that participants exercised harder in the presence of the reinforcer-focused phrases. Experiment 2 tested a similar comparison using phrases focused on consequences that were shown to be neutral or negative by the IRAP, and found no consistent effect on responding. These results support a key prediction from previous research in Relational Frame Theory, namely that reinforcer-focused statements can function as motivative augmentals, and they suggest that such motivative effects can impact behaviours of applied importance such as exercise.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - This research aimed to develop the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) as a measure of treatment acceptability and to assess teachers’ acceptability of reinforcement and punishment interventions in the presence of 'good' and 'bad' behaviors. Participants included 15 teachers trained in ABA (ABATs) who worked with children with developmental disabilities, and 15 teachers trained in mainstream primary education (MTs) who worked with typically developing children. On the IRAP, the ABAT group showed proreinforcement biases for all behaviors, while MTs showed a proreinforcement bias for good behavior but a propunishment bias for bad behavior. On explicit measures of acceptability, although both groups showed proreinforcement and antipunishment biases, the ABATs rated reinforcement as significantly more acceptable than the MTs; the ratings of punishment did not differ across the two groups. The research provides support for the IRAP as a measure of treatment acceptability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although depression is characterised by low self-esteem as measured by questionnaires, research using implicit measures of self-esteem has failed to reveal the expected differences between depressed and non-depressed individuals. In this study, we used an implicit measure which enables the differentiation of ideal self- and actual self-esteem, through the introduction of propositions: 'I am' versus 'I want to be'. We measured implicit relational associations about actual and ideal self in low (N = 27) versus high dysphoric (N = 29) undergraduates. Our data revealed that dysphoric individuals have a higher ideal self-esteem, and lower actual self-esteem in comparison to healthy participants. The results underscore the need to go beyond simple associations and suggest that the use of individual–specific propositions could enhance our understanding of the implicit measurement of self-esteem. Furthermore, these results underscore the importance of actual versus ideal self-discrepancy theories, which might guide the content of therapeutic interventions.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Stigmatizing attitudes about individuals with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) are known to contribute to the individual's psychological problems and response to treatment. Providers of SUD treatment services have been shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures. However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD treatment and therapist training.

T2  - Eating Behaviors
AB  - The freshman year of college has been identified as a time when some students experience large changes in their eating behaviors, body image, and weight. One factor that is predictive of changes in these variables is internalization of the thin ideal (i.e., the degree to which an individual has accepted societal values of thinness and applies these values to herself). However, given the limitation of self-report and previous research demonstrating the additional predictive validity implicit measurement provides, it may be important to develop an implicit paradigm for assessing internalization of the thin ideal. The Implicit Association Test is the most common implicit measurement technique. However this test is associational in nature, which reflects only one aspect of human cognition. The current study evaluates a newly-created implicit measure of internalization of the thin ideal that utilizes the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In particular, the study investigates concurrent and prospective associations between internalization of the thin ideal and disordered eating, body image dissatisfaction, and weight in a group of women at the beginning and end of their freshman year in college. Results of the study indicate that weight, disordered eating and body image dissatisfaction increased during the freshman year, and that these were predicted by implicit internalization of the thin ideal at the beginning of the year. Moreover, the new implicit measure was predictive above and beyond any predictive ability of the explicit measure. Results indicate that the thin ideal IRAP can successfully predict changes in many variables of interest at the freshman year of college, and suggest it may be a beneficial screening tool to assess at-risk freshman. This study also highlights the need for additional implicit measures in the realm of body image and disordered eating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Behavior and Social Issues
AB  - Racial evaluations have received considerable attention by researchers of implicit cognition, especially with the Implicit Association Test (IAT). The IAT measures associative biases in a relativistic manner, whereby attitudes toward a given racial category are compared to attitudes toward another. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a new behavior analytic measure of cognition that may provide a less relativistic and more specific measure of cognitive repertoires. The current study utilized a race IRAP to assess evaluative biases among a balanced sample of Black and White undergraduates. The race IRAP was administered twice in a row in conjunction with a collection of self-report measures of racial attitudes. Results for reliability and convergent validity were generally supportive. Furthermore, observed biases appeared to reflect positive in-group biases rather than derogatory attitudes toward the out-group, an effect that would not be apparent with a similarly configured race IAT. Future research may benefit from consideration of the evaluative content of the IRAP as well as the racial demographics for both the participants and the experimenters.

AU  - Scanlon, Geraldine

T2  - Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties
AB  - Pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) are often considered the most challenging group to manage within mainstream education. The challenges perceived by teachers may be due, in part, to negative attitudes towards this cohort of pupils, which may exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and impact negatively upon direct interactions with pupils. The current study comprised a combination of implicit (i.e. the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, IRAP) and explicit (The Opinions Relative to Mainstreaming Scale, ORMS) technologies to assess the attitudes of teachers (N = 25) and teachers in training (N = 20) towards pupils with EBD. When these attitudes proved to be negative (relative to typically developing pupils), the utility of a combined behaviour intervention (BI) and stress-management intervention (SMI), in conjunction with a series of pre and post measures, was examined. The IRAP results for teachers indicated that the SMI enhanced their implicit positivity towards pupils with EBD (EBD PUPIL) to a considerable extent (0.025-0.175), and this was greater than the impact recorded with the BI. The teachers in training showed implicit negativity towards EBD PUPIL (0.13) and this decreased, albeit marginally, at post-BI (0.05) and post-SMI (0.06). Significant differences were recorded in teachers’ general attitudes towards inclusion (p < 0.001) and efficacy (p < 0.008). Significant effects were recorded for teachers in training in relation to their attitudes towards having a child with EBD and having a previously excluded child with EBD in their classrooms (all ps < 0.001). For this latter group, reductions were also recorded in their levels of depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.001) and there was an increase in their psychological flexibility (p < 0.001). The current results indicate that a range of positive implicit and explicit outcomes was associated with the current BI and SMI package in terms of fostering more effective inclusion of pupils with EBD in mainstream education.

T2  - Behaviour Research and Therapy
AB  - It has been proposed that a crucial link between cognitive (i.e., self-schemas) and biological vulnerability is prefrontal control. This is because decreased control leads to impaired ability to inhibit ruminative thinking after the activation of negative self-schemas. However, current evidence is mainly correlational. In the current experimental study we tested whether the effect of neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on self-esteem is mediated by momentary ruminative self-referential thinking (MRST) after the induction of negative self-schemas by criticism. We used a single, sham-controlled crossover session of anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC (cathode over the right supraorbital region) in healthy female individuals. After receiving tDCS/sham stimulation, we measured MRST and exposed the participants to critical audio scripts, followed by another MRST measurement. Subsequently, all participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures to implicitly measure actual and ideal self-esteem. Our behavioral data indicated a significant decrease in MRST after real but not sham tDCS. Moreover, although there was no immediate effect of tDCS on implicit self-esteem, an indirect effect was found through double mediation, with the difference in MRST from baseline to after stimulation and from baseline to after criticism as our two mediators. The larger the decrease of criticism induced MRST after real tDCS, the higher the level of actual self-esteem. Our results show that tDCS can influence cognitive processes such as rumination, and subsequently self-esteem, but only after the activation of negative self-schemas. Rumination and negative self-esteem characterize different forms of psychopathology, and these data expand our knowledge of the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling these self-referential processes, and the mechanisms of action of tDCS.

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - Purpose: Self-esteem (SE), or one's sense of competence and worth, is reduced in many mental and physical disorders. Low SE is associated with perceived stigma and disability and poor treatment outcomes. The present study examined implicit and explicit SE (automatic and deliberate views about the self) in people with epilepsy and people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). Discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE have been found to correlate with psychological distress in disorders often associated with PNESs but are relatively unexplored in PNESs. We hypothesized that, compared with epilepsy, PNESs would be associated with lower self-reported SE and greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE. Methods: Thirty adults with PNESs, 25 adults with epilepsy, and 31 controls without a history of seizures were asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale as a measure of explicit SE and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit SE. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire—15 (a somatic symptom inventory) were also administered. Results: We found significant group differences in explicit (p < 0.001) but not implicit SE. Patients with PNESs reported lower SE than the other groups. No group differences were found in implicit SE. Implicit–explicit SE discrepancies were larger in the group with PNESs than in the other groups (p < 0.001). Higher frequency of PNESs (but not epileptic seizures) was associated with lower explicit SE (rs = −.83, p < 0.01) and greater SE discrepancies (i.e., lower explicit relative to implicit SE; rs = .65, p < 0.01). These relationships remained significant when controlling for anxiety and somatization. Conclusion: Patients with PNESs had lower explicit SE than those with epilepsy or healthy controls. In keeping with our expectations, there were greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE among patients with PNESs than in the other groups. Our results, including the strong relationship between PNES frequency, anxiety, and explicit–implicit SE discrepancies, support the interpretation that PNESs serve to reduce cognitive dissonance, perhaps protecting patients' implicit SE.

T2  - Research in Developmental Disabilities
AB  - Tutors trained in applied behaviour analysis (n = 16) and mainstream school teachers (n = 16) were exposed to an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) designed to assess implicit attitudes towards individuals with autism versus normally developing individuals. Participants also completed a range of explicit measures, including measures of professional burnout and psychopathology. All participants produced more negative biases towards children with autism compared to children who were normally developing. Increased negativity towards autism on the IRAP predicted similar attitudes on some of the explicit measures and also correlated with increased levels of self-reported psychopathology and professional burnout for the tutors working with children with autism. Results suggest that implicit measures of attitudes may provide a marker for professional burnout. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Nicholson, Emma
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry
AB  - Background and objectives: There is increasing evidence that disgust responding occurs at both a primary and secondary level in the form of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. The unique contributions of anxiety and disgust need to be established if disgust is to be implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary objective of the current study was to develop two separate implicit measures of disgust propensity and sensitivity and to explicate the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in avoidance behavior and OC tendencies. Methods: The current study (N = 33 undergraduate students) utilized a measure of implicit cognition, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to independently analyze disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. In addition, a series of behavioral approach tasks (BAT) and questionnaires measuring general disgust, obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies and general psychopathology were implemented to validate the implicit measures. Results: Disgust sensitivity predicted avoidance behavior on the BATs independent of disgust propensity and anxiety, while disgust propensity did not. Both disgust propensity and sensitivity predicted self-reported OC tendencies and individually predicted obsessing and washing concerns, respectively. Limitations: Our findings are based on a non-clinical student sample and further research is required for generalization to OCD. Conclusions: The implicit measures appeared to be measuring two separate constructs and had differential relationships with behavior and OC tendencies. Overall, the results support current theories relating to pathological disgust and OCD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study examined the impact of a brief verbal rehearsal task on performance on two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs), actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a behavioral approach task; BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT. Participants first completed the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) followed by one of two verbal rehearsal tasks, one of which focused on fear acceptance and the other on fear reduction as ways of coping with fear. All participants then completed two IRAPs similar to those employed by Leech, Barnes-Holmes, and Madden (The Psychological Record, 66(3), doi: 10.1007/s40732-016-0176-1 , 2016). Finally, participants completed the BAT using a live common house spider. Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. No significant differences between the two verbal-rehearsal conditions emerged on the self-report measures, the IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated in the reduce-fear condition. When considered in the context of the results previously reported by Leech et al., the differential pattern of correlations observed in the current study suggest that the verbal rehearsal task impacted upon a behavior–behavior relation that may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the acceptance and commitment therapy literature.

Images of slim individuals elicited EMG responses consistent with more positive affect. Data from both the IRAP and IAT indicated higher levels of bias than were revealed on the explicit measures, and the IRAP also corroborated the EMG pattern by indicating responses consistent with pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias. The IRAP was moderately correlated with both EMG and the IAT and was the only measure to predict behavioral intentions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Psychosocial interventions for substance dependence have demonstrated efficacy. However, the mechanisms by which specific intervention strategies exert their effect have not been clearly identified. Objective: This study investigated the prospective relationships between two psychological processes, an attentional bias toward cocaine stimuli and beliefs about the consequences of cocaine use, and treatment outcome. Method: Twenty-five cocaine-dependent participants enrolled in a 6-month outpatient treatment program that included voucher incentives for abstinence. All participants were asked to complete two implicit assessment procedures, a Drug Stroop protocol and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as well as explicit measures of cocaine craving and the consequences of cocaine use, prior to beginning treatment. Pearson’s correlation coefficients tested the prospective relationships between treatment outcome and the implicit and explicit assessments. Results: Stronger implicit beliefs about the positive effects of cocaine use prior to treatment were associated with poorer treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was in place. Further, an attentional bias for cocaine-related stimuli was associated with better treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was removed. No association between cocaine use beliefs and treatment outcome was found when beliefs were measured with self-report instruments. Conclusions and scientific significance: These findings highlight the potential utility of performance-based measures for delineating the psychological mechanisms associated with variation in response to treatment for drug dependence.

T2  - Journal of Health Psychology
AB  - Two measures of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared with each other and with a measure of explicit attitudes in the assessment of implicit pro-slim/anti-fat bias. Results from both implicit tests indicated higher levels of bias than revealed by the explicit measure. The IRAP data suggested that it was participants’ pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias, which was driving this effect. Explicit attitudes and feelings towards the overweight were significant predictors of behavioural intentions towards the overweight with the IRAP offering a greater contribution to predictive validity than the IAT.

T2  - International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy
AB  - The current study aimed to provide an implicit measure of experiential avoidance (EA). Fifty undergraduate participants were exposed to an implicit (Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure: IRAP) and an explicit (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II: AAQ II) measure of EA. Subsequently participant’s response latencies on viewing a negatively affective IAP image were recorded. Participants were randomly assigned to either a thought suppression, or mindfulness group. The induction for both groups involved a 10 minute audio file that operationalized either suppression or mindfulness as a useful coping strategy for unwanted thoughts about the negatively affective IAP image. In the last stage of the experiment participants were re-exposed to both the AAQ II and the IRAP in order to determine whether the respective inductions had impacted on participant’s level of EA (either explicitly or implicitly). The results indicated that the mindfulness group experienced a reduction of EA from pre to postinduction in comparison to those in the thought suppression group on the implicit measure (IRAP) but not the explicit measure (AAQ II). Results are discussed in terms of the utility of an implicit measure of experiential avoidance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Participants completed a before/after and a similar/different relational task, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), and subsequently look the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT). For each relational task, response latencies were measured first on consistent trials, where participants responded in accordance with preestablished verbal relations, and then on inconsistent trials, where they responded against these relations. A difference-score was calculated by subtracting consistent from inconsistent response latencies. The inconsistent trials and the difference-score provided measures of relational flexibility. Results showed that faster responding on the IRAP and smaller difference- scores predicted higher IQ, These findings suggest that relational flexibility is an important component of intelligence and might therefore be targeted in educational settings.

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - This study examined implicit and explicit anxiety in individuals with epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) and explored whether these constructs were related to experiential avoidance and seizure frequency. Based on recent psychological models of PNESs, it was hypothesized that nonepileptic seizures would be associated with implicit and explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance. Explicit anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; implicit anxiety was measured by an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; and experiential avoidance was measured with the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire. Although both groups with epilepsy and PNESs scored similarly on implicit measures of anxiety, significant implicit–explicit anxiety discrepancies were only identified in patients with PNESs (p < .001). In the group with PNESs (but not in the group with epilepsy), explicit anxiety correlated with experiential avoidance (r = .63, p < .01) and frequency of seizures (r = .67, p < .01); implicit anxiety correlated with frequency of seizures only (r = .56, p < .01). Our findings demonstrate the role of implicit anxiety in PNESs and provide additional support for the contribution of explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance to this disorder.

T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - The current article reports the findings from two preliminary experiments investigating the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Implicit Relational Association Procedure (IRAP) as measures of implicit attitudes in the domain of work and leisure among North American and Irish individuals. The IAT and IRAP tasks involved responding under time pressure on a computerized task, with response latency as the dependent variable. The IAT required participants to categorize positively or negatively valenced words with stimuli associated with either Work or Holidays. The IRAP required that participants confirm or deny that Work and Holidays are similar or opposite to positively and negatively valenced words. Participants also completed an explicit measure consisting of a Likert-based questionnaire. In both Experiments, citizens of the United States of America produced performances on the IAT and IRAP that indicated more negative attitudes to work and more positive attitudes to holidays than both Canadian and Irish citizens. Responses on the explicit measures did not accord with this overall pattern of group differences. The results support the use of the IRAP as a measure of implicit attitudes and furthermore the findings appear to be generally consistent with a recent large-scale survey of attitudes to work across 23 countries.

T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB  - Experiment 1 aimed to establish “fearful” and “pleasant” functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar' Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.

T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
AB  - Research on self-determination theory has typically relied on explicit measures when examining the concept of competence need satisfaction. As a result, we know relatively little about competence need satisfaction that arises under conditions of automaticity. Across four studies, we developed and validated implicit measures of competence need satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together, these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence. Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low reliability of the IRAP.

AU  - O'Shea, Brian
T2  - SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Why is it difficult to sustain collective action that challenges the political and economic status quo? To develop an answer to this central problem in the study of social movements, this paper investigates the possible role of cognitive mechanisms using the framework of System Justification Theory. It examines the explicit and implicit attitudes of London bankers and Occupy St. Paul's protesters towards capitalism and an alternative economic system (Resource Based Economy: RBE) using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure and questionnaires. As hypothesised, bankers were more likely than protesters to demonstrate positive attitudes towards conservative capitalistic worldviews/values on both explicit and implicit measures. Also as expected, protesters had more positive explicit attitudes towards the RBE than did bankers. However, implicit attitudes towards the RBE were neutral for both groups. The implicit capitalism measures correlated positively with the explicit Capitalism Semantic Differential Scales (SDS) and negatively with the RBE SDS. No correlations were found between the implicit RBE measures and any of the explicit SDSs. The central theoretical insight of this paper is that implicit attitudes play an important role in maintaining the status quo, and that cognitive factors may underpin the resilience of extant social, political and economic structures.

T2  - CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB  - Research using explicit measures has linked decreased positive future thinking, but not increased negative future thinking, with clinical depression. However, individuals may be unable or unwilling to express thoughts about the future, and can be unaware of implicit beliefs that can influence their behavior. Implicit measures of cognition may shed light on the role of future thinking in depression. To our knowledge, the current study presents the first implicit measure of positive and negative future thinking. A sample of 71 volunteers (38 healthy; 33 with sub-clinical depression) completed both implicit and explicit measures of positive and negative future thinking. The findings indicate differences in the evaluation of both positive and negative future events between the two groups. However, group differences were more pronounced on the implicit measure. These findings point to the potential utility of an implicit measure of future thinking in mental health research and clinical practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
AB  - Plain English summary Body dissatisfaction can be thought of as the discrepancy between actual and desired body size. This is typically measured with rating scales depicting a series of body silhouettes of increasing size, from extreme thinness to fatness. Respondents mark the points that match their current body size and the one they would ideally like to be (the more distance between both, the more body dissatisfaction). Like all self-reports, these scales are liable to self-presentation biases. Experimental procedures that require respondents to answer under time pressure (implicit measures) tap into more automatic reactions that are less amenable to deliberate manipulation. This study used one such procedure (the IRAP) to examine how rapidly participants identified themselves (or not) with pictures of underweight or overweight, and how rapidly they expressed a desire to be (or not) like such pictures. Participants did not show a clear discrepancy between their actual and their ideal body size with the IRAP. However, automatic reactions indicative of acceptance/rejection of the idea of becoming fatter, predicted the degree of body image distress as measured with different instruments. Unwillingness to accept this idea was associated with more severe symptoms of disordered eating. Background The discrepancy between actual and ideal body image is considered an index of body dissatisfaction and a risk factor for eating disorders. While discrepancy has been traditionally tested with figural drawing rating scales, in recent times the use of implicit measures has been explored. Methods This study employs the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to examine actual-ideal body-size discrepancy in a sample of 130 Spanish college students, as well as its utility to predict symptoms of eating disorders and other body-image relevant measures. Participants completed the Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS). The three smallest and the three largest contour drawings of the CDRS were used as target stimuli in two different IRAP tasks: one in combination with the sample phrases “I am” and “I am not” (that assessed implicit actual body image), another in combination with the phrases “I want to be” and “I don't want to be” (that assessed implicit ideal body image). After completing both IRAP tasks, participants completed explicit measures of body-image psychological inflexibility, body dissatisfaction, and symptoms of eating disorders. Results Results showed a small implicit bias towards thinness. Participants were faster in affirming than denying that they are thin and that they desire to be thin. They were also faster in affirming than denying that they are fat and that they want to be fat, but to a smaller extent than with thinness. Specifically, the implicit desire to be (or not be) fat emerged as an independent predictor of eating disorder symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and body dissatisfaction that significantly increased the predictive power of CDRS scores. Conclusions These findings underscore the need for further research on specific body image implicit beliefs towards fatness, both in subclinical and clinical populations, in order to examine whether willingness to accept the idea that one can have a larger body size can be a suitable target for prevention and intervention in eating disorders.

AU  - Cullen, Claire

T2  - The psychology of modern prejudice
AB  - Findings from American poll data spanning the last two decades reveal that attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are becoming more liberal. Despite these trends, however, self-report data may fall victim to a range of confounds including self-presentational biases. Recently, researchers have begun to assess implicit homo-negativity (i.e., attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women that are relatively unconscious and beyond volitional control) using a range of implicit measures. This chapter reviews the studies published to date in the area of implicit homo-negativity. The findings show that implicit attitudes as measured by the Implicit Association Test, the Sequential Priming Procedure and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure differ as a function of group status (i.e., heterosexual versus non-heterosexual). Specifically, implicit in-group "pride" and out-group "prejudice" were repeatedly produced by heterosexual participants. In contrast, non-heterosexuals were relatively egalitarian in their expression of implicit attitudes. Furthermore, in many of the studies, a divergence in performance between implicit and explicit attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women was observed.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Recent research has indicated that the results of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) may be affected by certain facets of the measure. The current research explores the use of response options in the IRAP and their potential influence on the responding of college students (N = 40) across two similar IRAPs. The IRAPs differed solely in the different types of response option used: contextually cued relational responses (C-rels) or relational coherence indicators (RCIs). The terms “same”/”opposite” served as C-rel response options whereas the RCI response options were “right”/”wrong.” The expected IRAP effect was evident on D-scores from both IRAPs. This effect was shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used (Wilk's Lambda = .86, F (1, 36) = 6.05, p = .02, eta(2)(p) = .14.), however, there was no statistically significant effect shown for the order of their presentation, nor were any other interaction effects detected. Potential implications and possible avenues for future research are discussed.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Cognitive perspective-taking research has primarily been conducted under the rubric of theory of mind (ToM), with the core skill believed to involve the correct attribution of mental states to oneself and others as a means of explaining and predicting behavior. Relational frame theory (RFT) has provided a behavioral account of performances on true and false belief protocols by appealing to the three perspective-taking (deictic) relations. The current research sought to investigate the relative strength of cognitive perspective-taking abilities within the context of a false belief vignette and related IRAP. Experiment 1 investigated the impact of block order presentation and vignette stimuli order on IRAP performances. That is, across four conditions, rule order presentations (i.e., vignette consistent vs. vignette inconsistent) and vignette stimuli presentation were manipulated. Results indicated that vignette consistent responding was observed to varying degrees across conditions. To decrease this variability across conditions, Experiment 2 presented a vignette before each block of trials but again the IRAP showed only limited sensitivity to the vignette. The current findings and considerations for future research are discussed in terms of a recently published conceptual analysis of false belief by Kavanagh et al. (2020).

The current research aimed to explore teachers’ implicit and explicit gender-biased attitudes towards children with ADHD and anxiety. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to measure implicit bias, and results were analyzed in relation to explicit measures. Results indicated that teachers (N = 38) showed implicit and explicit gender biases, however there were no significant relationships between the implicit and explicit measures. The research adds to the small pool of existing literature on the topic and has potential implications regarding teachers’ understanding of ADHD and anxiety.

AB  - The research literature remains unclear as to whether discrimination of bullying improves with age, thus the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to investigate if college students compared to post-primary students showed increased discrimination of phrases with bullying potential. Participants (N = 60; n = 30 post-primary and n = 30 university students) completed the IRAP in which trial-blocks alternately affirmed or denied innocuous v. toxic phrases as harmless or abusive. Shorter response latencies for particular trial-blocks meant participants responded more rapidly, thus indicating preference. Pre- and post-IRAPs were also conducted to determine if an intervention (government educational videos) increased participants’ implicit preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, or decreased preference for toxic phrases. IRAP data showed a statistically significant implicit preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, for both post-primary and university students, with no statistically significant difference between these groups. There was no difference in IRAP results pre and post a brief educational intervention, thus the research did not support the intervention. Analysis of participants’ explicit data (self-report questionnaires) indicated no age differences for prosocial behaviour or attitudes towards victims. Thus, age was not shown to improve discrimination of bullying in the current research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - Attractiveness bias is a robust finding in social domains, but the data is less clear regarding attractiveness bias in other domains including employability. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to investigate implicit attractiveness bias favouring employability for attractive versus unattractive facial image stimuli with a sample of university students (N = 35; 25 Females). The IRAPs four trial-type methodology facilitated a nuanced analysis to determine if participant data showed pro-attractive bias, anti-attractive bias, some combination of both, or no evidence of any such bias. A pro-attractive bias was found in D-scores on three of the four IRAP trial-types. Results from an explicit Beliefs About Appearance Scale (BAAS; Spangler, 1999) showed high ratings for the importance of appearance for employability across both genders with no statistically significant gender impact. Findings extend extant research providing nuanced data about implicit attractiveness bias beyond social domains in the important area of employability.

T2  - Behavioural Processes
AB  - Experiment 1 of the current research attempted to establish fear and avoidance functions for arbitrary stimuli via combinatorial entailment using training and testing versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The critical tests for the transformation of functions involved exposure to two separate Test-IRAPs (one for fear and one for avoidance), but both failed to yield any evidence for the transformation of functions. The findings of Experiment 1 contrast with the clear evidence of a transformation of functions via mutually entailed relations that was reported by Leech et al. (2018), thus suggesting a potential boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and testing context (i.e., derived transformation occurs for mutual but not combinatorial entailing). In Experiment 2, we sought to manipulate two of the dimensions of the multi-dimensional multi-level (MDML) framework to determine if they would alter the apparent boundary condition suggested by the results of Experiment 1. Results indicate that levels of derivation and an opportunity to respond to the derived relations play an important role in the transformation of fear and avoidance functions via combinatorial entailment within the IRAP context.

AB  - Under a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) framework, researchers have investigated the role of deictic relational responding (perspective-taking) in the analysis of self in relation to others, place, and time. The aim of the current research was to develop IRAPs that targeted deictic relational responding with regard to the mental states of self and others. This was pursued in a series of experiments that employed a novel version of the IRAP, known as the Natural Language-IRAP (NL-IRAP). The use of the NL-IRAP allowed for the presentation of relatively complex statements that required participants to infer the thoughts or beliefs of others on a trial-by-trial basis within the IRAP. Across a sequence of six experiments, a 'self-focused IRAP' required participants to respond to both positive and negative statements about themselves, whereas an 'other-focused IRAP' required participants to respond to similar statements about others. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated perspective-taking with regard to an unspecified other. Experiments 3–6 investigated perspective-taking with regard to a specified other, with the specified relationship between self and other manipulated across experiments. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that the other-focused IRAP produced overall bias scores that were significantly stronger than responding to the self-focused IRAP. It is interesting that nonsignificant differences were recorded across Experiments 3–6 when other was specified. The findings obtained across the six studies highlight potentially important limitations in the use of the NL-IRAP as a measure of perspective-taking.

AB  - The current study aimed to investigate whether the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) can be a suitable measure of hopelessness in elderly people. At the moment, studies involving implicit attitude assessments in this population are scarce and this study sought to contribute to the literature in this field. Thirty-seven participants (average age = 65) with normal cognitive functioning completed the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and an IRAP designed to measure hopelessness. Results revealed significant correlations between BHS and IRAP scores. In addition, performance in two IRAP trial types predicted BHS clusters on high and low hopelessness. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first article describing an attempt to apply the IRAP as a procedure for psychological assessment of elderly people. The results suggest that further research for procedural refinement is needed and the potential application of the IRAP as a complement to self-report instruments for the diagnosis of hopelessness and depression.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - Self-compassion encompasses three factors: self-kindness, mindfulness, and common humanity. This study aimed to explore the factor of common humanity (the belief that suffering is a shared human experience) and whether people tend to identify with this factor more in relation to their own experiences or those of others. Previously, it has been suggested that when applying compassion, people tend to be harsher on themselves and more compassionate toward others. Most research in self-compassion has typically used explicit measures, which can be scientifically limiting. The present study employed an implicit measure, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to explore this domain. Participants (N = 55) completed the IRAP and its analog scale as well as Neff's self-compassion scale. Results showed that explicitly, participants reported high levels of common humanity and lack of isolation for both themselves as well as others. Implicitly, however, while they showed similar patterns in three of these four trial-types (i.e., common humanity regarding self and others and isolation with respect to others) they were neutral regarding self-isolation. Implications and limitations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Women are often subject to gender stereotyping in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to determine directionality of any implicit gender-STEM bias detected. In addition, the IRAP was used to explore the possibility of implicit ageism bias, because there is anecdotal evidence of high levels of ageism in the STEM areas. Thus two IRAPs (one with adult pictorial stimuli and one with child pictorial stimuli) were employed to assess implicit gender bias toward STEM with a sample of undergraduates (N = 33). Results indicated a gender STEM bias in both IRAPs and the directionality in both IRAPs was pro-male and not anti-female. Participant gender was not shown to impact results in either IRAP. Gender bias effects were more pronounced in the Adult-IRAP results. Comparison of bias toward older versus young pictorial stimuli was exploratory thus findings are preliminary but may suggest ageism and potential negative interaction effects between age and gender warrant further research.

AB  - Attractiveness bias has been well-documented in social domains, however, an investigation into the attractiveness-bias effect on employability has not been conducted using implicit measures. In Study 1 (N = 24) the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and a number of explicit measures (e.g., self-report questionnaires) were used to investigate the attractiveness-bias effect on employability using stimuli of high and low attractiveness. Results from Study 1 indicated that there was a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable on explicit and implicit measures. In Study 2, (N = 52) these measures were used to investigate the attractiveness-bias effect on employability using stimuli of high and medium attractiveness. Results from Study 2 indicated that there was a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable on explicit measures and a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable and medium-attractive-unemployable on implicit measures. There was no effect of participant gender on D-scores for either study. Findings are discussed in relation to previous research and implications for the use of implicit measurement to measure attractiveness bias in the domain of employability.

AB  - A key aspect of self-forgiveness is that one needs to acknowledge one’s failings and their consequences. The present study used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and an explicit IRAP analog measure to examine (1) responding to perceived failure following exposure to an insoluble task, and (2) the effect of a defusion intervention on responding in this context. Participants (n = 29) were first assessed for baseline performance on an IRAP and IRAP analog that assessed participants in terms of perceived relations between performance (success vs. failure) and feelings (positive vs. negative). They were then exposed to the insoluble task, after which they were asked to report on their performance and their feelings in relation to the task. They were subsequently assigned to hear either a defusion (n = 14) or control (n = 15) audio recording and were reexposed to the implicit and explicit measures. IRAP results showed significant denial of failure as leading to positive feelings for both groups following the insoluble task, whereas the explicit (IRAP analog) measure failed to show any comparable effect of this task. As regards the defusion intervention, no effect was seen at the implicit level whereas effects at the explicit level were ambiguous. Results and future directions are discussed.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been typically used to access behavioral biases to relations that the participants learned throughout their history of social interactions. Recent research has highlighted the role of the stimulus orienting function on IRAP performance. The present study used the IRAP to assess preference biases for smartphone application (app) icons, namely WhatsApp and Messenger, and intended to check if these biases correspond to the orienting function of these stimuli in a visual search paradigm monitored by eye tracking. The IRAP presented relations between the WhatsApp and Messenger icons and happy or angry facial expressions. The visual search task had two steps: in Step 1, matrices of app icons were designed to emulate smartphone screens, and the participant was instructed to find either the WhatsApp or the Messenger icon; in Step 2, happy or angry faces were presented as targets in matrices of pictures of neutral faces that functioned as distractors. Participants were more prompted to respond Yes than No to the relation between the WhatsApp icon and happy facial expressions in IRAP trials, and showed ambivalent bias to the Messenger icon. Regarding the visual search performance, participants’ were faster to find the WhatsApp target than to find the Messenger target. In addition, they were faster to find the happy targets than the angry targets. Results from the current study corroborate the hypothesis that the stimulus orienting function may play an important role on IRAP performance and, as a result, are supportive to the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model.

T2  - Behavioural Processes
AB  - The effects of rules on human behaviour have long been identified as important in the psychological literature. The increasing importance of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous research has suggested may differentially impact persistent rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development: mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly, however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results across both experiments and their implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research examined the reliability and validity of the Change Agenda Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (CA-IRAP). Change agendas that lead people to think that 'reducing or removing undesirable thoughts and feelings will solve problems and lead to a more successful life' are considered unworkable in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). For acceptance-based interventions to succeed, relinquishing change agendas is important. However, currently available methods for measuring these types of change agendas are limited to explicit measures, which are vulnerable to distortion from social desirability and demand characteristics. The authors attempted to measure change agendas using the IRAP. A total of 131 undergraduate and graduate students (40 male, 91 female; mean age = 21.93, SD = 3.19) participated. First, we examined the CA-IRAP’s discriminant validity in relation to explicit measures such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II in 83 participants who were able to pass the CA-IRAP. The correlations between the CA-IRAP and the explicit measures were low, confirming the discriminant validity of the CA-IRAP. Second, we examined the predictive validity of the CA-IRAP. Nineteen respondents had learned ACT and 34 respondents had never learned ACT. Non-ACT learners’ CA-IRAP scores were higher than those of ACT learners, which confirmed the CA-IRAP’s predictive validity. Finally, we examined the CA-IRAP’s test–retest reliability, which was confirmed across some CA-IRAP trial types. In conclusion, the authors submit that the CA-IRAP has strong potential as a valid instrument for measuring the relative strength of relational responses around change agendas while controlling for variables such as demand characteristics.

AB  - A recently published article reported a particular pattern of responding that has been observed on the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), referred to as a Single-Trial-Type-Dominance-Effect (STTDE; Finn, Barnes-Holmes, & McEnteggart in The Psychological Record, 68(1), 11–25, 2018). To account for the phenomenon, the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model of IRAP performance was proposed. The DAARRE model predicts the STTDE in terms of an overlap in the functional properties of the label, target, and response-option stimuli presented within an IRAP. This article presents an initial attempt at engineering a STTDE within an experimental session. Forty participants were exposed to a series of training procedures and IRAPs. The training procedures consisted of a series of trials that aimed to establish a 'True' function for a picture stimulus that was subsequently presented in the IRAP; participants were then exposed to an IRAP in which participants were required to respond 'True' on a specific trial-type that presented that picture. Consistent with the DAARRE model, the STTDE emerged for the predicted trial-type, with analyses at both the group and individual participant level supporting this conclusion. The implications of the findings for future research on analyzing the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding are discussed.

AB  - This study analyses the validity of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an implicit measure on in-group and out-group bias in Spanish participants from Catalonian (n = 17) and from the Rest of Spain (n = 16). The IRAP required to respond relationally in alternating trial-blocks. In the pro-Catalan block, participants had to respond as if the word Catalan, with the Catalonian flag behind it, were related with positive attributes (e.g. polite) and the word Spanish, with the Spanish flag behind it, were related with negative attributes (e.g. rude). In contrast, in the pro-Spanish block participants had to respond as if the word Spanish, with the Spanish flag behind it, were related with positive attributes (e.g. innovative) and the word Catalan, with the Catalonian flag behind it, were related with negatives attributes (e.g. opportunist). Participants also completed a demographic questionnaire and an explicit measure with stimuli analogous to the IRAP ones. The results showed more a favourable bias toward the ingroup in both groups, but this favourable bias is more pronounced in the Catalan Group. These results highlight the validity of the IRAP to measure intergroup biases. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy
AB  - Previous research on mock-jury trials has shown an explicit attractiveness bias in participant attributes of innocence. This study used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure attractiveness-bias in implicit evaluations of innocence or guilt with a sample of 46 college students. Alternate IRAP trial-blocks required participants to affirm relations consistent and inconsistent with attractiveness bias (attractive-innocent/unattractive guilty versus unattractive-innocent/ attractive-guilty). Faster responding across consistent trial-blocks was interpreted in terms of implicit stereotype. Participants’ beliefs about the importance of their own appearances were examined using the Beliefs about Appearances Scale (BAAS) and explicit attractiveness ratings for the IRAP photographic stimuli were measured using Likert scales; analysis examined relationships between these beliefs and IRAP scores. Results revealed statistically significant attractiveness bias for both male and female participants; specifically, both a pro-attractiveness and anti-unattractive bias. Findings are discussed regarding research in implicit evaluations of innocence or guilt and effects of attractiveness bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Behavior and Social Issues
AB  - Gender stereotypes affect both women and men from childhood. Whereas men may be more often associated with STEM careers, women tend to be associated with nurturing and caring careers. The present research used an explicit scale and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure to investigate how gender–career relational patterns could vary for Brazilian college students according to their gender and career. Both instruments included the names of careers stereotypically regarded as 'male' or 'female' and words indicating gender. Participants were divided into four groups (men and women in STEM and the humanities). A significant pro-male–STEM bias emerged for all groups, except the STEM-female group, the only group to show a significant pro-female-STEM bias (p < .05) and a significant difference from the other three groups. A significant implicit pro-men–male career bias was mostly more substantial among male students. In the explicit scales, participants tended to show a more neutral evaluation (not classifying careers as 'male' or 'female'). Correlations were found between explicit evaluations for male careers and the implicit trial type 'women–male careers,' indicating that the more a career was explicitly evaluated as male, the more easily it was related with 'women' as false at the implicit level.

AB  - This study extended previous research on the effect of education and communication on anti-autism bias and stigmatization, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an assessment tool and employing undergraduates as participants. Experiment 1 examined the effect of a simple video and text-based educational intervention on attitudes towards autism, as assessed both using the IRAP and various explicit measures. Participants received either an educational video–text combination or a control video–text combination before exposure to the assessments. Findings showed positive responding towards both normally developing and autism spectrum individuals across both conditions on both the IRAP and the explicit measures. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of two different types of online video-based narrative regarding autism, one negatively oriented and the other positively oriented, on both implicit and explicit responding. Findings suggested that the negative video affected both implicit and explicit responding, albeit in different ways. Responding on the IRAP showed a stronger pro-normally developing bias whereas explicit responding showed a stronger anti-autism bias. Implications and possible future directions are discussed.

AU  - De Raedt, Rudi
T2  - Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry
AB  - Background and objectives: According to the Neurocognitive Framework for Regulation Expectation (NFRE), actual and ideal self-esteem are related to how individuals anticipate and respond to a stressful event. Based on this framework, we investigated whether in individuals with low ideal self-esteem (moderator), a positive relationship between actual self-esteem and reactive autonomic regulation would be mediated by the amount of anticipatory autonomic regulation. Methods: Forty-five healthy females prepared a speech (i.e., anticipation) and performed it in front of a camera (i.e., stressor). Actual and ideal self-esteem were measured with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. Anticipatory and reactive autonomic stress regulation were indexed by heart rate variability, and affective responses were assessed via self-report. Results: Results were in line with predictions based on the NFRE: when ideal self-esteem was low, higher actual self-esteem was associated with higher reactive autonomic regulation, and this association was mediated by higher anticipatory autonomic regulation. Limitations: Because only female undergraduates were recruited, replication within a more heterogeneous sample is necessary to further generalize these findings. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis, based on the NFRE, that actual and ideal self-esteem interact in predicting the relationship between anticipatory and reactive stress regulation, and are a step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying successful stress regulation.

AB  - The IRAP (Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure) is a procedure developed for the assessment of beliefs, attitudes, and other implicit cognitive elements. Stimuli-related variables that influence IRAP performance have been studied, but not the influence of social situation variables of the test itself. Gender stereotypes are one of the implicit beliefs most studied with the IRAP. Gender bias relational responses may be brought under the functional control of situational social variables, such as responding in a mixed gender group or responding in a single gender group (women only/men only). One hundred and ten undergraduates (65 women and 45 men; aged 18–22) performed a collective IRAP application about gender stereotypes. In the first experimental condition, the test was applied in mixed gender groups. In the second experimental condition, the test was applied in single gender groups. The results showed that gender stereotypes were present in men’s and women’s responses to the IRAP. Both male and female participants showed greater gender bias when responding in single gender groups than in mixed gender groups in all the IRAP trial types. The social context in which IRAP was applied influenced the participant's performance. The advantages of collective IRAP applications are also discussed.

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The current study investigated the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding involving emotional pictographs (emojis) used in electronic messages by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). College students (N = 41) were trained to establish two classes of equivalent stimuli, each comprising a happy or an angry emoji, and three pseudo-words that presumably became symbols of the emotional pictographs. In a subsequent IRAP test, combinations of symbols (labels) and emojis (targets) generated four trialtypes (with the consistent response within parentheses): happy symbol–happy emoji (true); happy symbol–negative emoji (false) negative symbol–happy emoji (false); and negative symbol–negative emoji (true), referred to as trial types 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A positive score occurred only for trial-type 1 [happy symbol–happy emoji (true)]. Scores for trial-types 2 and 4 were close to zero, and the score for trial-type 3 [negative symbolhappy emoji (false)] was negative. This negative D-IRAP score means that participants were faster to respond true than false for the combination of negative symbol and happy emoji. These results are discussed in terms of the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model. It is hypothesized that the orienting and evoking (functional) properties of the positive target stimulus (happy emoji) and the positive response option (true) had a stronger bearing on participants’ responding in trial type 3 than the relation between the label and target stimuli presented in this trial. We argue that the current study provides an empirical demonstration of a dissonant target trial type effect (DTTTE) that appeared to counter equivalence relations trained within the experimental session and discuss implications for IRAP research.

AU  - Hong, Bao

AU  - Sun, Hongri
T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - This experimental study explored the use of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) for understanding the vertical spatial metaphor of power. In the classic IRAP procedure, we formed four sets of stimuli based on the relationship between power words (powerful and powerless words) and vertical position on a computer screen (upper or lower) that were either pro-metaphor (i.e., powerful-high, powerless-low) or anti-metaphor (i.e., powerful-low, powerless-high). Participants were then asked to judge whether the words were consistent or inconsistent with the set of instructions given to them. We found that the Dirap scores of powerful words in an above vertical space and powerless words in a below vertical space were higher than zero. Furthermore, the Dirap scores of the pro-metaphor stimuli were significantly greater than were those of the anti-metaphor stimuli. Vertical spatial position metaphor of power concepts was verified again by IRAP. These findings suggest that there is an established spatial metaphor for power, which we explain using relational frame theory. It is the first study to our knowledge to explore this metaphor using the IRAP, which overcomes the limitations of paradigms such as the implicit association test, and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of the metaphor.

AU  - Hernández-López, Mónica
AU  - Antequera-Rubio, Alba
AU  - Rodríguez-Valverde, Miguel
T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - Research on implicit attitudes to body image has grown substantially in recent years. The extant evidence reveals an implicit weight bias in the general population that has generally been interpreted in terms of anti-fat attitudes. However, research with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) shows that this bias appears to be driven by pro-slim rather than anti-fat implicit attitudes. Besides, the only IRAP study of this sort conducted in Spain found no evidence of such implicit weight bias (with similarly positive attitudes to thinness and fatness). Given the existing differences in body dissatisfaction (BD) among diverse cultural contexts, we predicted that discrepancies in findings about implicit weight bias might be related to differences in BD amongst the samples in the different studies. This study explores whether women with extreme scores in BD (High vs. Low) show different patterns of attitudes to female body shape. Spanish female college students with extreme scores in the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ: high ≥ 104, percentile 80; low ≤ 52, percentile 20) completed an IRAP with pictures of overweight and underweight women as target stimuli and the words pleasant and unpleasant as labels. Participants also completed explicit ratings to the same stimuli and clinically relevant measures of body image related distress. Results showed an implicit weight bias only for women high in BD. While both groups showed equally positive implicit attitudes to thinness, only women with low BD showed implicit positive attitudes to fatness (and hence no bias). In turn, both groups presented a clear pro-thin/anti-fat explicit bias with positive ratings for underweight pictures and negative ratings for overweight pictures. The latter were stronger for the high BD group. Therefore, between-group differences were mainly driven by differences in attitudes to fatness (both implicit and explicit). Both implicit and explicit attitudes to fatness independently predicted eating disorders symptoms and other clinically relevant measures. These results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studies on equivalence relations have suggested that abstract symbols might acquire emotional functions when related to facial expressions. The present study aimed to investigate the transformation of emotional functions from facial expressions of fear and of happiness to abstract stimuli via equivalence relations. A delayed matching-to-sample task established two equivalence classes between facial expressions of emotions and nonsense abstract stimuli: A1(Fear)-B1-C1-D1; A2(Happiness)-B2-C2-D2. After relational training (AB, AC, CD) and equivalence tests (BD, DB), the participants evaluated the meaning of one nonsense stimulus from each class (D1 and D2) by means of a semantic differential and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from both the semantic differential and the IRAP supported the conclusion that the emotional functions of the faces, in terms of fear and happiness, had transformed via the equivalence classes to the D stimuli. Results are discussed in terms of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two studies are presented that involved exploring four different versions of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to target self-relevant stimulus relations. Experiment 1 employed stimuli from previous research that used the IRAP to target stimulus relations pertaining to self, and self-esteem in particular. Experiment 2 aimed to explore the use of different types of stimuli (i.e., pictures as well as words), that again focused on self-related stimulus relations, and their potential correlations with measures of self-esteem and psychological distress. Experiment 1 yielded broadly similar findings to those reported previously. Experiment 2 showed that only one trial type from the IRAP using pictures depicting success versus failure correlated with the measures of self-esteem and psychological distress; none of the remaining 11 trial types across the three IRAPs yielded any significant correlations. The current findings may be seen as relatively progressive when presented in the context of a theoretical model that may be used, albeit in a post-hoc manner, to interpret the specific IRAP response patterns obtained in the current and previously published research. In particular, an in-depth RFT conceptual analysis of the findings using a recently proposed model of IRAP effects is presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, white participants were exposed to a single-label or multiple-label racial bias IRAP before and after a faking instruction (i.e., two exposures to the IRAP). The faking instruction involved asking all participants to imagine that they were a black person when completing the second IRAP. The results indicated that participants produced evidence of pro-white and anti-black biases both before and after receiving the faking instruction. Analyses of variance revealed no main or interaction effects for the single- versus multiple-label variable, and trial-type specific paired t-tests yielded no significant differences between the pre- and post-faking instruction IRAPs. The results were consistent with previous racial bias findings using the IRAP and supported the conclusion that faking only occurs when participants are provided with specific information about the task parameters. Implications for faking research, and the impact of instructions generally, on the IRAP are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science
AB  - The current study aimed to explore the relationship between implicit and explicit gender bias in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, and selection behavior among seventy STEM students. The selection behavior focused on gendered beliefs about STEM ability by assessing via a selection task how often participants chose a male or a female as the better performer on a number of STEM-related tasks. Participants then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and rating scales to assess implicit and explicit bias respectively. Men and women STEM students exhibited a statistically significant, large implicit pro-Men-STEM bias while women also demonstrated a significant pro-Women-STEM bias. Explicitly, both groups demonstrated a Male-STEM/Female-Arts bias. While selection task scores were not significantly biased, they did correlate with implicit scores on the Men-STEM IRAP trial-type. The results highlighted the subtle nuances that can be revealed by assessing both implicit and explicit gender-STEM biases, particularly when utilizing a measure such as the IRAP. Limitations and future research directions are addressed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) assesses the relative strength of derived relational responding. A growing body of IRAP research has focused on assessing verbal relations pertaining to the self and others. This preliminary study sought to determine the feasibility of using matched pictures of self and of others across two IRAPs (N = 32). Both the self- and other-IRAPs also presented pictures of pens as the contrast category. The results of the IRAPs were broadly consistent with common-sense expectations. That is, participants confirmed more readily than they denied that a picture of a face was a face and that a picture of a pen was a pen. They also denied more readily than confirmed that a picture of a pen was a face and that a picture of a face was a pen. No significant differences in the sizes of the individual trial type effects, or differences among those effects, emerged between the two (self and other) IRAPs. However, two key differential trial type effects did emerge for both IRAPs, which relate directly to recent and on-going conceptual developments surrounding the IRAP and the analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding in general. These developments are considered and discussed in detail toward the end of the article. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Teacher Behavior Checklist (TBC) consists of 28 items mainly used to measure college teachers’ performance or to investigate the primary qualities of good teachers. Psychometric studies using the TBC have presented evidence of its validity and reliability in different cultures. However, TBC content validity is exclusively based on self-reported measurements, which presents limitations that are widely discussed in the literature. Our study sought to investigate an alternative measurement for TBC content validity using a latency-based task, namely the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The main objective was to assess the strength of the relationship between the concept of 'Good Teacher' and 'Bad Teacher' and six positive and negative features derived from TBC items using an IRAP preparation. The second objective was to investigate the correlation between IRAP and TBC scores. The participants were 64 undergraduate students (M = 21; F = 43), aged 16 to 36. The IRAP trials included six target stimuli selected from the TBC that could be either 'Good Teacher' or 'Bad Teacher,' and six labels that could be either positive or negative features. The IRAP revealed that the 'Good Teacher' is 'Positive,' not 'Negative.' On the other hand, the 'Bad Teacher' is 'Negative,' but participants could not deny that this teacher has 'Positive' features. Only one statistically significant correlation was found between the Good Teacher-Negative IRAP trial type and the TBC score. Future studies should expand the use of implicit measurements in psychometric studies using the TBC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Paliliunas, Dana

T2  - Behavior and Social Issues
AB  - The present study sought to measure potential implicit biases regarding modest and revealing clothing worn by college-age females reporting sexual harassment in terms of the believability of the claim using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. In addition, participants’ responding in public and private experimental conditions was compared. Results were analyzed to determine if implicit biases regarding the believability of sexual harassment complainants related to their clothing were observed. No significant difference was found between the private and public contexts, F(1, 46) = 0.7780, p = 0.3824. A significant bias in favor of women dressed in modest clothing was observed in the overall scores for the public context, t(23) = 5.272, p < 0.0001; additional analyses for individual trial types are included. These results may suggest that, although participants did not demonstrate significant bias against women dressed in revealing clothes, a bias in favor of women dressed modestly was present. This study produced preliminary data that may be indicative of an increased likelihood of a claim of sexual harassment/assault being observed as 'believable' when the claimant’s clothes are of a more modest fashion.

T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - The stimulus equivalence paradigm presented operational criteria to identify symbolic functions in observable behaviors. When humans match dissimilar stimuli (e.g., words to pictures), equivalence relations between those stimuli are likely to be demonstrated through behavioral tests derived from the logical properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. If these properties are confirmed, one can say that those stimuli are members of an equivalence class in which each member is substitutable for the others. A number of studies, which have established equivalence classes comprised of arbitrary stimuli and pictures of faces expressing emotions, have found that valences of the faces affect the relatedness of equivalent stimuli. Importantly, several studies reported stronger relational strength in equivalence classes containing happy faces than in equivalence classes containing angry faces. The processes that may account for this higher degree of relatability of happy faces are not yet known. The current study investigated the dynamics of the symbolic relational responding involving facial expressions of different emotions by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were 186 undergraduate students who were taught to establish two equivalence classes, each comprising pictures of faces expressing either happiness (for one class) or a negative emotion (for another class), and meaningless words. The IRAP effect was taken as an index for the relational strength established between equivalent stimuli in the different equivalence classes. The dynamics of arbitrary relational responding in the course of the four IRAP trial types revealed that the participants exhibited a stronger IRAP effect in trials involving the happy faces and a weaker IRAP effect in trials involving the negative faces. These findings indicate that the happy faces had higher impact on the symbolic relational responding than the negative faces. The potential role played by the orienting function of happy vs. negative faces is discussed. By considering other studies that also reported a happiness superiority effect in other contexts, we present converging evidence for the prioritization of positive affect in emotional, categorical, and symbolic processing.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Empirical analysis of features of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure may be important to results. As such, the current research compared effects of response options that were contextually cued relational responses (Crels) versus relational coherence indicators (RCIs) across two IRAPs conducted with college student participants (N = 40). The IRAPs were similar except for the response options used, which were either 'Same'/'Opposite' (Crels) versus 'Accurate'/'Inaccurate' (RCIs). D-scores for both IRAPs showed the expected IRAP effect (bias). A critical difference was noted dependent upon the type of response options used: the IRAP effect was shown to be stronger when Crel response options were used. There was no statistically significant interaction effect shown between response option used and order of completion (i.e., Crel IRAP first vs. RCI IRAP first), however, there was a statistically significant interaction effect shown between type of response options used on the IRAP, order of completion, and block-order presentation (consistent trial-blocks vs. inconsistent trial blocks presented first). Findings are discussed regarding potential implications and further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal
AB  - The current study assessed the impact of three brief interventions aimed at influencing implicit gender bias in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. The reduction of this bias is a key consideration as it remains a major barrier to gender equality in STEM. The interventions (psychoeducation, exposure to positive counter-stereotypical exemplars and perspective-taking) were compared to a control group at two timepoints. Gender-STEM bias was assessed at the implicit level (via the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; IRAP) and the explicit level (via rating scales). Two hundred and ten adults (58.1% women) completed one of the four study conditions. Results indicated that implicit gender-STEM bias is malleable, at least in the short term. At Time 1, intervention groups showed higher levels of implicit pro-Women-STEM bias and lower levels of pro-Men-STEM bias than the Control group. Psychoeducation appeared most effective, followed by exposure to positive counter-stereotypical exemplars. Results from Time 2 presented a more complex picture of implicit bias change, as the control group exhibited an increased pro-Women-STEM bias that was unexpected. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to refining the interventions, the malleability of gender-STEM bias and the measurement of implicit bias across contexts.

AB  - Caregivers of people with dementia who endorse dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving are at high risk of experiencing higher levels of distress. These dysfunctional beliefs are presented in the form of rules, verbal statements that specify what responsibilities one should expect in order to be a 'good caregiver,' and are characterized as rigid, unrealistic, or highly demanding. Previous studies relied exclusively on self-report measures when assessing such dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop and validate an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving (CARE-IRAP), and 2) considering the relatively high age of the sample, to analyze the adaptation of the IRAP for older adults, comparing the IRAP performance between older adult caregivers and middle-aged caregivers. Participants were 123 dementia family caregivers with a mean age of 62.24 ± 12.89. Adaptations were made to the IRAP by adjusting the accuracy and response time criteria. The sample was split into middle-aged caregivers (below 60 years) and older adult caregivers (60 or older). The CARE-IRAP scores presented significant positive correlations with explicit measures of dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and experiential avoidance in caregiving. A similar pattern of results was observed across the two age groups. The results revealed that caregivers endorse implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and offer preliminary support for the use of the IRAP as a valid measure of implicit caregiving beliefs. This exploratory study is the first to adapt the IRAP criteria to older adults, and future studies should further explore criteria suitable for this population.

T2  - Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties
AB  - Research has shown that the attitudes of teachers towards pupils can influence their academic and social behaviour. In the context of special education needs (SEN), the same processes likely apply, and there is evidence that teachers’ attitudes influence the success of inclusive initiatives. While the literature on attitudes to pupils with SEN is limited, there is also a heavy reliance on self-reported methodologies that are susceptible to presentation bias. Across two studies, the current research employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure the implicit attitudes of teachers in training (N = 20), primary school teachers (N = 20), and post-primary teachers (N = 20) and a group of controls (N = 20) towards pupils with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (EBD), versus the implicit attitudes of primary school teachers (N = 20) and post-primary teachers (N = 20) towards typically-developing pupils. Results indicated that teachers possessed greater negative implicit and explicit attitudes towards pupils with EBD, when compared to typically-developing pupils.

T2  - The Psychological Record
AB  - Motivative augmentals are rules or statements that temporarily change the effectiveness of a consequence, similar to establishing operations for nonverbal consequences (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, & Roche, 2001). Many communications by an organization's leadership may function as such and alter the function of stimuli in the workplace, which in turn may influence employee behaviors (Houmanfar & Rodrigues, Journal of Applied Radical Behavior Analysis, N1, 22–27, 2012). There is a lack of experimental research regarding this, however, particularly under different organizational pay systems (i.e., financial contingencies), which have been repeatedly shown to influence performance (e.g., Gupta & Shaw, Compensation and Benefits Review, 30(2), 26–32, 1998; Locke, Feren, McCaleb, Shaw, & Denny, 1980). The current study sought to compare the two by measuring the effect of motivational statements on individual versus cooperative responding under two different pay-for-performance contingencies in an organizational analogue. Stimuli for the motivational statements were selected utilizing an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) with one group of participants, and these statements were then tested under piece-rate and profit-share conditions with a second group of participants in a counterbalanced reversal design. Results indicated that the financial contingencies had more of an effect on responding, but that motivational statements influenced behavior as well. In particular, motivational statements affected whether a participant chose to cooperate or behave individually more under financially neutral conditions (i.e., profit share) when there was no financial cost for doing so. As such, organizations can utilize memos or speeches to increase performance, but it is important for the content to align with financial contingencies in order to maximize performance.

AB  - The current study sought to investigate perspective-taking in a group of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The Social Anxiety Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (SA-IRAP) contrasted statements and questions referring to ‘anxious’ and ‘non-anxious’ experiences. The SA-IRAP and a Faux-pas (Theory of Mind) test were presented to two groups of participants: a clinical group with a diagnosis of social anxiety and a group of controls. IRAP effects for each group were in the predicted direction and a ROC analysis showed that the IRAP correctly classified 77% of the individuals with social anxiety with a sensitivity level of 97% and a specificity level of 36%. The IRAP was thus successfully used to correctly classify the sample of clinical individuals. However, the study also demonstrated that the two groups were similar with regard to their level of competency on the perspective-taking IRAP. The article also discusses the relationship between the data and recent developments in RFT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study sought to investigate perspective-taking in a group of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The Psychosis Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (Psychosis-IRAP) contrasted statements and questions referring to ‘psychotic’ and ‘non-psychotic’ experiences. The IRAP and a Faux-pas (Theory of Mind) test were presented to two groups of participants: a clinical group with a diagnosis of psychosis and a control group. IRAP effects for each group were in the predicted direction and a ROC analysis showed that the IRAP correctly classified 80% of the individuals with psychosis with a sensitivity level of 84.2% and a specificity level of 27.8%. The IRAP was thus successfully used to correctly classify the population of clinical individuals. However, the study also demonstrated that the two groups were similar with regard to their level of competency on the perspective-taking IRAP. The article also discusses the relationship between the data and recent developments in RFT, in terms of relational flexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In exploring the extent to which the Implicit Relational Assessment procedure (IRAP) may function as a measure of the derived transformation of functions, it is important to determine if it is also sensitive to particular moderating variables. This was the purpose of the current study, which focused on manipulating three different motivating conditions related to stimuli presented during the IRAP task. First, two equivalence classes were established: A1-B1-C1-D1 and A2-B2-C2-D2. These classes comprised nonsense forms (B, C, and D) and two meaningful stimuli: a picture of a glass full of water (A1) and a neutral picture (A2). Derived transformation of function from the meaningful stimuli to two nonsense forms (D1 and D2) was then assessed by means of a semantic differential and an IRAP. Before assessment, participants were divided in three groups: the first had water intake; the second had pepper; the third had pepper before the semantic differential, followed by an extra dose before the IRAP testing blocks. Results suggest that the motivative conditions progressively affected both measures. Regarding the semantic differential, D1 (water) and D2 (neutral) stimuli were close to neutrality for the Water group; for the Pepper and Double Pepper groups, however, the D1 (water) stimulus had a positive valence whereas D2 (neutral) was neutral. In the IRAP, both the Water and Pepper group evaluated D1 as positive; nonetheless, for the Double Pepper group, IRAP scores revealed that D1 was even more positive compared to the other groups. Implications for the IRAP are discussed in terms of the DAARRE model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Psychodynamic and cognitive theories postulate a prominent role of aggressiveness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Explicit assessment of aggressiveness in OCD has yielded diverging results. The present study aimed to investigate aggressiveness in OCD using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Method: Patients with OCD (n = 59) were compared to non-clinical controls (NCs; n = 31) on an IRAP using self-referential statements and the explicit State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II (STAXI-II). During the computer-based IRAP, participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately ('correct' or 'incorrect') to the relation of two presented stimuli (e.g., 'I am' + 'aggressive'). Results: DIRAP-Scores for the I am aggressive trial type were significantly higher in NCs compared to the OCD sample (d = 0.73). Patients with OCD scored significantly higher on the Trait Anger scales and the Anger Expression-Out scale of the STAXI-II. The I am aggressiveDIRAP-Score correlated with the overall Trait Anger scale (r = −.33, p = .001) and with the Anger Expression-In scale (r = −0.31, p = .003). Conclusions: Patients with OCD were more ambivalent about their own aggressiveness than NCs. These findings were in line with patients’ explicit aggressiveness.

TI  - Fear and Avoidance: A Three-Day Investigation on the Impact of a Fear-Related Verbal-Rehearsal Task on a Behavior-Behavior Relation
AU  - Leech, Aileen

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Recent research suggests that fear and avoidance responding based on derived transformation of functions may be considered functionally independent. The current study examined the impact of a fear-related verbal-rehearsal task on performance on two implicit relational assessment procedures (IRAPs), actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT. The study was conducted over 3 separate days. Day 1 involved exposure to a series of questionnaires, the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and homework. Day 2 involved a second exposure to the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. The final day involved a second exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., control, accept, or reduce fear). Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. (2017). No significant differences between the conditions emerged on the self-report measures, IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated almost exclusively in the control and reduce-fear conditions rather than the accept-fear condition. The replication of results reported here provide further evidence of the functional independence of approach and avoidance responding. Furthermore, the differential pattern of correlations observed provide further evidence that the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task affected a behavior-behavior relation, which may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the ACT literature. In addition, the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model offers an alternative explanation for the results reported.

AB  - In many educational systems, ethnic minority students score lower in their academic achievement, and consequently, teachers develop low expectations regarding this student group. Relatedly, teachers' implicit attitudes, explicit expectations, and causal attributions also differ between ethnic minority and ethnic majority students-all in a disadvantageous way for ethnic minority students. However, what is not known so far, is how attitudes and causal attributions contribute together to teachers' judgments. In the current study, we explored how implicit attitudes and causal attributions contribute to preservice teachers' judgments of the low educational success of an ethnic minority student. Results showed that both implicit attitudes and causal attributions predicted language proficiency and intelligence judgments. Negative implicit attitudes, assessed with the IRAP, and internal stable causal attributions led to lower judgments of language proficiency, whereas lower judgments of intelligence were predicted by positive implicit attitudes and higher judgments of intelligence by external stable attributions. Substantial differences in the prediction of judgments could be found between the IRAP and BIAT as measures of implicit attitudes.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most important ways of fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal can reduce adherence to vaccination campaigns, and therefore undermine their effectiveness. Although the scientific community has made great efforts to understand the psychological causes of vaccine hesitancy, studies on vaccine intention have usually relied on traditional detection techniques, such as questionnaires. Probing these constructs explicitly could be problematic due to defense mechanisms or social desirability. Thus, a measure capable of detecting implicit attitudes towards vaccination is needed. To achieve this aim, we designed and validated a new test called the Vaccine-IRAP, or V-IRAP, which is a modified version of the original Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, or IRAP, task. The V-IRAP allows the unspoken reasons behind vaccine hesitancy to be investigated, and is able to distinguish between positive and negative beliefs on vaccination. The test was assessed in a sample of 151 participants. The V-IRAP showed good internal reliability and convergent validity, with meaningful correlational patterns with explicit measures. Moreover, it revealed incremental validity over such explicit measures. Lastly, the V-IRAP was able to shed light on the implicit attitudes involved in vaccine refusal, revealing negative attitudes relative to vaccine-related risks in non-vaccinated participants. Overall, these results support V-IRAP as a sensitive and reliable tool that could be used in future studies on implicit attitudes toward vaccination.
