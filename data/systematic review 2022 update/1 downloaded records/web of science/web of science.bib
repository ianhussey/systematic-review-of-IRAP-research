Abstract = {This research examined the reliability and validity of the Change Agenda
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (CA-IRAP). Change agendas that
   lead people to think that ``reducing or removing undesirable thoughts
   and feelings will solve problems and lead to a more successful life{''}
   are considered unworkable in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).
   For acceptance-based interventions to succeed, relinquishing change
   agendas is important. However, currently available methods for measuring
   these types of change agendas are limited to explicit measures, which
   are vulnerable to distortion from social desirability and demand
   characteristics. The authors attempted to measure change agendas using
   the IRAP. A total of 131 undergraduate and graduate students (40 male,
   91 female; mean age = 21.93,SD= 3.19) participated. First, we examined
   the CA-IRAP's discriminant validity in relation to explicit measures
   such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II in 83 participants
   who were able to pass the CA-IRAP. The correlations between the CA-IRAP
   and the explicit measures were low, confirming the discriminant validity
   of the CA-IRAP. Second, we examined the predictive validity of the
   CA-IRAP. Nineteen respondents had learned ACT and 34 respondents had
   never learned ACT. Non-ACT learners' CA-IRAP scores were higher than
   those of ACT learners, which confirmed the CA-IRAP's predictive
   validity. Finally, we examined the CA-IRAP's test-retest reliability,
   which was confirmed across some CA-IRAP trial types. In conclusion, the
   authors submit that the CA-IRAP has strong potential as a valid
   instrument for measuring the relative strength of relational responses
   around change agendas while controlling for variables such as demand
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Attractiveness bias is a robust finding in social domains, but the data
   is less clear regarding attractiveness bias in other domains including
   employability. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was
   used to investigate implicit attractiveness bias favouring employability
   for attractive versus unattractive facial image stimuli with a sample of
   university students (N=35; 25 Females). The IRAPs four trial-type
   methodology facilitated a nuanced analysis to determine if participant
   data showed pro-attractive bias, anti-attractive bias, some combination
   of both, or no evidence of any such bias. A pro-attractive bias was
   found in D-scores on three of the four IRAP trial-types. Results from an
   explicit Beliefs About Appearance Scale (BAAS; Spangler, 1999) showed
   high ratings for the importance of appearance for employability across
   both genders with no statistically significant gender impact. Findings
   extend extant research providing nuanced data about implicit
   attractiveness bias beyond social domains in the important area of
   employability.},

Abstract = {Women are often subject to gender stereotyping in the fields of science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to determine directionality of any
   implicit gender-STEM bias detected. In addition, the IRAP was used to
   explore the possibility of implicit ageism bias, because there is
   anecdotal evidence of high levels of ageism in the STEM areas. Thus two
   IRAPs (one with adult pictorial stimuli and one with child pictorial
   stimuli) were employed to assess implicit gender bias toward STEM with a
   sample of undergraduates (N= 33). Results indicated a gender STEM bias
   in both IRAPs and the directionality in both IRAPs was pro-male and not
   anti-female. Participant gender was not shown to impact results in
   either IRAP. Gender bias effects were more pronounced in the Adult-IRAP
   results. Comparison of bias toward older versus young pictorial stimuli
   was exploratory thus findings are preliminary but may suggest ageism and
   potential negative interaction effects between age and gender warrant
   further research.},

Title = {Development and Validation of an Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure (IRAP) to Measure Implicit Dysfunctional Beliefs about

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Caregivers of people with dementia who endorse dysfunctional beliefs
   about caregiving are at high risk of experiencing higher levels of
   distress. These dysfunctional beliefs are presented in the form of
   rules, verbal statements that specify what responsibilities one should
   expect in order to be a ``good caregiver,{''} and are characterized as
   rigid, unrealistic, or highly demanding. Previous studies relied
   exclusively on self-report measures when assessing such dysfunctional
   beliefs about caregiving. The objectives of this study were: 1) to
   develop and validate an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)
   to measure implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving (CARE-IRAP),
   and 2) considering the relatively high age of the sample, to analyze the
   adaptation of the IRAP for older adults, comparing the IRAP performance
   between older adult caregivers and middle-aged caregivers. Participants
   were 123 dementia family caregivers with a mean age of 62.24 +/- 12.89.
   Adaptations were made to the IRAP by adjusting the accuracy and response
   time criteria. The sample was split into middle-aged caregivers (below
   60 years) and older adult caregivers (60 or older). The CARE-IRAP scores
   presented significant positive correlations with explicit measures of
   dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and experiential avoidance in
   caregiving. A similar pattern of results was observed across the two age
   groups. The results revealed that caregivers endorse implicit
   dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and offer preliminary support for
   the use of the IRAP as a valid measure of implicit caregiving beliefs.
   This exploratory study is the first to adapt the IRAP criteria to older
   adults, and future studies should further explore criteria suitable for
   this population.},

Abstract = {Empirical analysis of features of the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure may be important to results. As such, the current research
   compared effects of response options that were contextually cued
   relational responses (C(rel)s) versus relational coherence indicators
   (RCIs) across two IRAPs conducted with college student participants (N =
   40). The IRAPs were similar except for the response options used, which
   were either ``Same{''}/{''}Opposite{''} (C-rels) versus
   ``Accurate{''}/{''}Inaccurate{''} (RCIs). D-scores for both IRAPs showed
   the expected IRAP effect (bias). A critical difference was noted
   dependent upon the type of response options used: the IRAP effect was
   shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used. There was no
   statistically significant interaction effect shown between response
   option used and order of completion (i.e., C-rel IRAP first vs. RCI IRAP
   first), however, there was a statistically significant interaction
   effect shown between type of response options used on the IRAP, order of
   completion, and block-order presentation (consistent trial-blocks vs.
   inconsistent trial blocks presented first). Findings are discussed
   regarding potential implications and further research.},

Abstract = {Self-compassion encompasses three factors: self-kindness, mindfulness,
   and common humanity. This study aimed to explore the factor of common
   humanity (the belief that suffering is a shared human experience) and
   whether people tend to identify with this factor more in relation to
   their own experiences or those of others. Previously, it has been
   suggested that when applying compassion, people tend to be harsher on
   themselves and more compassionate toward others. Most research in
   self-compassion has typically used explicit measures, which can be
   scientifically limiting. The present study employed an implicit measure,
   the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to explore this
   domain. Participants (N = 55) completed the IRAP and its analog scale as
   well as Neff s self-compassion scale. Results showed that explicitly,
   participants reported high levels of common humanity and lack of
   isolation for both themselves as well as others. Implicitly, however,
   while they showed similar patterns in three of these four trial-types
   (i.e., common humanity regarding self and others and isolation with
   respect to others) they were neutral regarding self-isolation.
   Implications and limitations are discussed.},

Abstract = {A key aspect of self-forgiveness is that one needs to acknowledge one's
   failings and their consequences. The present study used the Implicit
   Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and an explicit IRAP analog
   measure to examine (1) responding to perceived failure following
   exposure to an insoluble task, and (2) the effect of a defusion
   intervention on responding in this context. Participants (n = 29) were
   first assessed for baseline performance on an IRAP and IRAP analog that
   assessed participants in terms of perceived relations between
   performance (success vs. failure) and feelings (positive vs. negative).
   They were then exposed to the insoluble task, after which they were
   asked to report on their performance and their feelings in relation to
   the task. They were subsequently assigned to hear either a defusion (n =
   14) or control (n = 15) audio recording and were reexposed to the
   implicit and explicit measures. IRAP results showed significant denial
   of failure as leading to positive feelings for both groups following the
   insoluble task, whereas the explicit (IRAP analog) measure failed to
   show any comparable effect of this task. As regards the defusion
   intervention, no effect was seen at the implicit level whereas effects
   at the explicit level were ambiguous. Results and future directions are
   discussed.},

   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {This experimental study explored the use of the implicit relational
   assessment procedure (IRAP) for understanding the vertical spatial
   metaphor of power. In the classic IRAP procedure, we formed four sets of
   stimuli based on the relationship between power words (powerful and
   powerless words) and vertical position on a computer screen (upper or
   lower) that were either pro-metaphor (i.e., powerful-high,
   powerless-low) or anti-metaphor (i.e., powerful-low, powerless-high).
   Participants were then asked to judge whether the words were consistent
   or inconsistent with the set of instructions given to them. We found
   that the Dirap scores of powerful words in an above vertical space and
   powerless words in a below vertical space were higher than zero.
   Furthermore, the D-irap scores of the pro-metaphor stimuli were
   significantly greater than were those of the anti-metaphor stimuli.
   Vertical spatial position metaphor of power concepts was verified again
   by D-irap. These findings suggest that there is an established spatial
   metaphor for power, which we explain using relational frame theory. It
   is the first study to our knowledge to explore this metaphor using the
   IRAP, which overcomes the limitations of paradigms such as the implicit
   association test, and provides a better understanding of the mechanism
   of the metaphor.},

Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},

Abstract = {Experiment 1 of the current research attempted to establish fear and
   avoidance functions for arbitrary stimuli via combinatorial entailment
   using training and testing versions of the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The critical tests for the transformation
   of functions involved exposure to two separate Test-IRAPs (one for fear
   and one for avoidance), but both failed to yield any evidence for the
   transformation of functions. The findings of Experiment 1 contrast with
   the clear evidence of a transformation of functions via mutually
   entailed relations that was reported by Leech et al. (2018), thus
   suggesting a potential boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and
   testing context (i.e., derived transformation occurs for mutual but not
   combinatorial entailing). In Experiment 2, we sought to manipulate two
   of the dimensions of the multi-dimensional multi-level (MDML) framework
   to determine if they would alter the apparent boundary condition
   suggested by the results of Experiment 1. Results indicate that levels
   of derivation and an opportunity to respond to the derived relations
   play an important role in the transformation of fear and avoidance
   functions via combinatorial entailment within the IRAP context.},

Title = {Testing the discrepancy between actual and ideal body image with the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Plain English summary Body dissatisfaction can be thought of as the
   discrepancy between actual and desired body size. This is typically
   measured with rating scales depicting a series of body silhouettes of
   increasing size, from extreme thinness to fatness. Respondents mark the
   points that match their current body size and the one they would ideally
   like to be (the more distance between both, the more body
   dissatisfaction). Like all self-reports, these scales are liable to
   self-presentation biases. Experimental procedures that require
   respondents to answer under time pressure (implicit measures) tap into
   more automatic reactions that are less amenable to deliberate
   manipulation. This study used one such procedure (the IRAP) to examine
   how rapidly participants identified themselves (or not) with pictures of
   underweight or overweight, and how rapidly they expressed a desire to be
   (or not) like such pictures. Participants did not show a clear
   discrepancy between their actual and their ideal body size with the
   IRAP. However, automatic reactions indicative of acceptance/rejection of
   the idea of becoming fatter, predicted the degree of body image distress
   as measured with different instruments. Unwillingness to accept this
   idea was associated with more severe symptoms of disordered eating.
   Background The discrepancy between actual and ideal body image is
   considered an index of body dissatisfaction and a risk factor for eating
   disorders. While discrepancy has been traditionally tested with figural
   drawing rating scales, in recent times the use of implicit measures has
   been explored. Methods This study employs the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to examine actual-ideal body-size
   discrepancy in a sample of 130 Spanish college students, as well as its
   utility to predict symptoms of eating disorders and other body-image
   relevant measures. Participants completed the Contour Drawing Rating
   Scale (CDRS). The three smallest and the three largest contour drawings
   of the CDRS were used as target stimuli in two different IRAP tasks: one
   in combination with the sample phrases ``I am{''} and ``I am not{''}
   (that assessed implicit actual body image), another in combination with
   the phrases ``I want to be{''} and ``I don't want to be{''} (that
   assessed implicit ideal body image). After completing both IRAP tasks,
   participants completed explicit measures of body-image psychological
   inflexibility, body dissatisfaction, and symptoms of eating disorders.
   Results Results showed a small implicit bias towards thinness.
   Participants were faster in affirming than denying that they are thin
   and that they desire to be thin. They were also faster in affirming than
   denying that they are fat and that they want to be fat, but to a smaller
   extent than with thinness. Specifically, the implicit desire to be (or
   not be) fat emerged as an independent predictor of eating disorder
   symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and body dissatisfaction that
   significantly increased the predictive power of CDRS scores. Conclusions
   These findings underscore the need for further research on specific body
   image implicit beliefs towards fatness, both in subclinical and clinical
   populations, in order to examine whether willingness to accept the idea
   that one can have a larger body size can be a suitable target for
   prevention and intervention in eating disorders.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the validity of the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure (IRAP) as an implicit measure on in-group and out-group bias
   in Spanish participants from Catalonian (n= 17) and from the Rest of
   Spain (n= 16). The IRAP required to respond relationally in alternating
   trial-blocks. In the pro-Catalan block, participants had to respond as
   if the word Catalan, with the Catalonian flag behind it, were related
   with positive attributes (e.g. polite) and the word Spanish, with the
   Spanish flag behind it, were related with negative attributes (e.g.
   rude). In contrast, in the pro-Spanish block participants had to respond
   as if the word Spanish, with the Spanish flag behind it, were related
   with positive attributes (e.g. innovative) and the word Catalan, with
   the Catalonian flag behind it, were related with negatives attributes
   (e.g. opportunist). Participants also completed a demographic
   questionnaire and an explicit measure with stimuli analogous to the IRAP
   ones. The results showed more a favourable bias toward the ingroup in
   both groups, but this favourable bias is more pronounced in the Catalan
   Group. These results highlight the validity of the IRAP to measure
   intergroup biases.},

Abstract = {The present study sought to measure potential implicit biases regarding
   modest and revealing clothing worn by college-age females reporting
   sexual harassment in terms of the believability of the claim using the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. In addition, participants'
   responding in public and private experimental conditions was compared.
   Results were analyzed to determine if implicit biases regarding the
   believability of sexual harassment complainants related to their
   clothing were observed. No significant difference was found between the
   private and public contexts, F(1, 46) = 0.7780, p = 0.3824. A
   significant bias in favor of women dressed in modest clothing was
   observed in the overall scores for the public context, t(23) = 5.272, p
   < 0.0001; additional analyses for individual trial types are included.
   These results may suggest that, although participants did not
   demonstrate significant bias against women dressed in revealing clothes,
   a bias in favor of women dressed modestly was present. This study
   produced preliminary data that may be indicative of an increased
   likelihood of a claim of sexual harassment/assault being observed as
   ``believable{''} when the claimant's clothes are of a more modest
   fashion.},

Abstract = {Objective: Psychodynamic and cognitive theories postulate a prominent
   role of aggressiveness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
   (OCD). Explicit assessment of aggressiveness in OCD has yielded
   diverging results. The present study aimed to investigate aggressiveness
   in OCD using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP).
   Method: Patients with OCD (n = 59) were compared to non-clinical
   controls (NCs; n = 31) on an IRAP using self-referential statements and
   the explicit State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II (STAXI-II).
   During the computerbased IRAP, participants were required to respond as
   quickly and accurately ({''}correct{''} or ``incorrect{''}) to the
   relation of two presented stimuli (e.g., ``I am{''} + ``aggressive{''}).
   Results: D-IRAP-Scores for the I am aggressive trial type were
   significantly higher in NCs compared to the OCD sample (d = 0.73).
   Patients with OCD scored significantly higher on the Trait Anger scales
   and the Anger Expression-Out scale of the STAXI-II. The I am aggressive
   D; RA p-Score correlated with the overall Trait Anger scale (r = -.33, p
   = .001) and with the Anger Expression-In scale (r = -0.31, p = .003).
   Conclusions: Patients with OCD were more ambivalent about their own
   aggressiveness than NCs. These findings were in line with patients'
   explicit aggressiveness.},

Title = {The Role of Relational Contextual Cues versus Relational Coherence
   Indicators as Response Options on the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},
Abstract = {Recent research has indicated that the results of the implicit
   relational assessment procedure (IRAP) may be affected by certain facets
   of the measure. The current research explores the use of response
   options in the IRAP and their potential influence on the responding of
   college students (N = 40) across two similar IRAPs. The IRAPs differed
   solely in the different types of response option used: contextually cued
   relational responses (C-rels) or relational coherence indicators (RCIs).
   The terms ``same{''}/{''}opposite{''} served as C-rel response options
   whereas the RCI response options were ``right{''}/{''}wrong.{''} The
   expected IRAP effect was evident on D-scores from both IRAPs. This
   effect was shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used
   (Wilk's Lambda = .86, F (1, 36) = 6.05, p = .02, eta(2)(p) = .14.),
   however, there was no statistically significant effect shown for the
   order of their presentation, nor were any other interaction effects
   detected. Potential implications and possible avenues for future
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed to explore the relationship between implicit and

   (STEM) fields, and selection behavior among seventy STEM students. The
   selection behavior focused on gendered beliefs about STEM ability by
   assessing via a selection task how often participants chose a male or a
   female as the better performer on a number of STEM-related tasks.
   Participants then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) and rating scales to assess implicit and explicit bias
   respectively. Men and women STEM students exhibited a statistically
   significant, large implicit pro-Men-STEM bias while women also
   demonstrated a significant pro-Women-STEM bias. Explicitly, both groups
   demonstrated a Male-STEM/Female-Arts bias. While selection task scores
   were not significantly biased, they did correlate with implicit scores
   on the Men-STEM IRAP trial-type. The results highlighted the subtle
   nuances that can be revealed by assessing both implicit and explicit
   gender-STEM biases, particularly when utilizing a measure such as the
   IRAP. Limitations and future research directions are addressed.},

Abstract = {The research literature remains unclear as to whether discrimination of
   bullying improves with age, thus the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure (IRAP) was used to investigate if college students compared to
   post-primary students showed increased discrimination of phrases with
   bullying potential. Participants (N= 60; n= 30 post-primary and n= 30
   university students) completed the IRAP in which trial-blocks
   alternately affirmed or denied innocuous v. toxic phrases as harmless or
   abusive. Shorter response latencies for particular trial-blocks meant
   participants responded more rapidly, thus indicating preference. Pre-
   and post-IRAPs were also conducted to determine if an intervention
   (government educational videos) increased participants' implicit
   preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, or decreased preference
   for toxic phrases. IRAP data showed a statistically significant implicit
   preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, for both post-primary and
   university students, with no statistically significant difference
   between these groups. There was no difference in IRAP results pre and
   post a brief educational intervention, thus the research did not support
   the intervention. Analysis of participants' explicit data (self-report
   questionnaires) indicated no age differences for prosocial behaviour or
   attitudes towards victims. Thus, age was not shown to improve
   discrimination of bullying in the current research.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {In exploring the extent to which the Implicit Relational Assessment
   procedure (IRAP) may function as a measure of the derived transformation
   of functions, it is important to determine if it is also sensitive to
   particular moderating variables. This was the purpose of the current
   study, which focused on manipulating three different motivating
   conditions related to stimuli presented during the IRAP task. First, two
   equivalence classes were established: A1-B1-C1-D1 and A2-B2-C2-D2. These
   classes comprised nonsense forms (B, C, and D) and two meaningful
   stimuli: a picture of a glass full of water (A1) and a neutral picture
   (A2). Derived transformation of function from the meaningful stimuli to
   two nonsense forms (D1 and D2) was then assessed by means of a semantic
   differential and an IRAP. Before assessment, participants were divided
   in three groups: the first had water intake; the second had pepper; the
   third had pepper before the semantic differential, followed by an extra
   dose before the IRAP testing blocks. Results suggest that the motivative
   conditions progressively affected both measures. Regarding the semantic
   differential, D1 (water) and D2 (neutral) stimuli were close to
   neutrality for the Water group; for the Pepper and Double Pepper groups,
   however, the D1 (water) stimulus had a positive valence whereas D2
   (neutral) was neutral. In the IRAP, both the Water and Pepper group
   evaluated D1 as positive; nonetheless, for the Double Pepper group, IRAP
   scores revealed that D1 was even more positive compared to the other
   groups. Implications for the IRAP are discussed in terms of the DAARRE
   model.},

Title = {Training and testing for a transformation of fear and avoidance

   study},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Experiment 1 aimed to establish ``fearful{''} and ``pleasant{''}
   functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those
   stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of
   these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing
   participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP
   employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of
   response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in
   the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the
   assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by
   the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response
   biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate
   the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar'
   Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results
   obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in
   Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by
   Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary
   condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for
   establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.},

Title = {Attempting to Analyze Perspective-Taking with a False Belief Vignette
   Using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},
Abstract = {Cognitive perspective-taking research has primarily been conducted under
   the rubric of theory of mind (ToM), with the core skill believed to
   involve the correct attribution of mental states to oneself and others
   as a means of explaining and predicting behavior. Relational frame
   theory (RFT) has provided a behavioral account of performances on true
   and false belief protocols by appealing to the three perspective-taking
   (deictic) relations. The current research sought to investigate the
   relative strength of cognitive perspective-taking abilities within the
   context of a false belief vignette and related IRAP. Experiment 1
   investigated the impact of block order presentation and vignette stimuli
   order on IRAP performances. That is, across four conditions, rule order
   presentations (i.e., vignette consistent vs. vignette inconsistent) and
   vignette stimuli presentation were manipulated. Results indicated that
   vignette consistent responding was observed to varying degrees across
   conditions. To decrease this variability across conditions, Experiment 2
   presented a vignette before each block of trials but again the IRAP
   showed only limited sensitivity to the vignette. The current findings
   and considerations for future research are discussed in terms of a
   recently published conceptual analysis of false belief by Kavanagh et
   al. (2020).},

Title = {Expanding the evidence of content validity for the Teacher Behavior
   Checklist using the IRAP: TBC's content validity using the IRAP},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The Teacher Behavior Checklist (TBC) consists of 28 items mainly used to
   measure college teachers' performance or to investigate the primary
   qualities of good teachers. Psychometric studies using the TBC have
   presented evidence of its validity and reliability in different
   cultures. However, TBC content validity is exclusively based on
   self-reported measurements, which presents limitations that are widely
   discussed in the literature. Our study sought to investigate an
   alternative measurement for TBC content validity using a latency-based
   task, namely the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The
   main objective was to assess the strength of the relationship between
   the concept of Good Teacher and Bad Teacher and six positive and
   negative features derived from TBC items using an IRAP preparation. The
   second objective was to investigate the correlation between IRAP and TBC
   scores. The participants were 64 undergraduate students (M = 21; F =
   43), aged 16 to 36. The IRAP trials included six target stimuli selected
   from the TBC that could be either Good Teacher or Bad Teacher, and six
   labels that could be either positive or negative features. The IRAP
   revealed that the Good Teacher is Positive, not Negative. On the other
   hand, the Bad Teacher is Negative, but participants could not deny that
   this teacher has Positive features. Only one statistically significant
   correlation was found between the Good Teacher-Negative IRAP trial type
   and the TBC score. Future studies should expand the use of implicit
   measurements in psychometric studies using the TBC.},

Abstract = {The IRAP (Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure) is a procedure
   developed for the assessment of beliefs, attitudes, and other implicit
   cognitive elements. Stimuli-related variables that influence IRAP
   performance have been studied, but not the influence of social situation
   variables of the test itself. Gender stereotypes are one of the implicit
   beliefs most studied with the IRAP. Gender bias relational responses may
   be brought under the functional control of situational social variables,
   such as responding in a mixed gender group or responding in a single
   gender group (women only/men only). One hundred and ten undergraduates
   (65 women and 45 men; aged 18-22) performed a collective IRAP
   application about gender stereotypes. In the first experimental
   condition, the test was applied in mixed gender groups. In the second
   experimental condition, the test was applied in single gender groups.
   The results showed that gender stereotypes were present in men's and
   women's responses to the IRAP. Both male and female participants showed
   greater gender bias when responding in single gender groups than in
   mixed gender groups in all the IRAP trial types. The social context in
   which IRAP was applied influenced the participant's performance. The
   advantages of collective IRAP applications are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, white participants were exposed to a single-label or

   (i.e., two exposures to the IRAP). The faking instruction involved
   asking all participants to imagine that they were a black person when
   completing the second IRAP. The results indicated that participants
   produced evidence of pro-white and anti-black biases both before and
   after receiving the faking instruction. Analyses of variance revealed no
   main or interaction effects for the single-versus multiple-label
   variable, and trial-type specific paired t-tests yielded no significant
   differences between the pre- and post-faking instruction IRAPs. The
   results were consistent with previous racial bias findings using the
   IRAP and supported the conclusion that faking only occurs when
   participants are provided with specific information about the task
   parameters. Implications for faking research, and the impact of
   instructions generally, on the IRAP are discussed.},

   successfully used to analyze the strength of symbolic relations. Taking

   (Frontiers in Psychology, 10(954),2019) reported a higher relational
   strength in equivalence classes containing happy faces than in those

   effect(HSE) was inferred from an IRAP that included stimuli presented
   during the equivalence training. Such HSE apparently had a stronger
   influence on IRAP performance than the equivalence training itself. In
   this article, we comment on these data and present a new analysis that
   supports a hypothesis raised by Bortoloti et al. (Frontiers in

Abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used to
   assess the probability of arbitrarily applicable relational responding
   or as an indirect measure of implicit attitudes. To date, IRAP effects
   have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which
   was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size
   measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect
   size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated
   with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semi-parametric
   measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement,
   \& Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate
   how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which
   are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models,
   in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide
   confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to
   include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.},

Title = {The IRAP as a Measure of Implicit Cognition: A Case of Frankenstein's
   Monster},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON BEHAVIOR SCIENCE},
Abstract = {The implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) was initially
   developed as a way to assess the strength and probability of natural
   verbal relations, as defined within relational frame theory (RFT), and
   was conceptually rooted within the behavior-analytic tradition. However,
   the IRAP quickly became employed primarily as a measure of implicit
   cognition, more in line with mainstream psychology than behavior
   analysis. In doing so, research using the IRAP increasingly employed
   ill-defined mainstream psychological terms, focused on correlational
   analyses with traditional psychometry, and thus emphasized prediction
   over the prediction-and-influence of behavior. Although perhaps
   beneficial to the study of implicit cognition, this approach could be
   argued to have limited the IRAP's utility in behavior analyses of human
   language and cognition. In the current article we will reflect on this
   suggestion, on the IRAPs place and current use in the field of behavior
   analysis, and on its potential future within behavioral psychology in
   light of recent conceptual and empirical advances in RFT. In doing so,
   it is hoped that the measure may be refined into a better understood,
   more precise, functional-analytic tool.},

Abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been typically
   used to access behavioral biases to relations that the participants
   learned throughout their history of social interactions. Recent research
   has highlighted the role of the stimulus orienting function on IRAP
   performance. The present study used the IRAP to assess preference biases
   for smartphone application (app) icons, namely WhatsApp and Messenger,
   and intended to check if these biases correspond to the orienting
   function of these stimuli in a visual search paradigm monitored by eye
   tracking. The IRAP presented relations between the WhatsApp and
   Messenger icons and happy or angry facial expressions. The visual search
   task had two steps: in Step 1, matrices of app icons were designed to
   emulate smartphone screens, and the participant was instructed to find
   either the WhatsApp or the Messenger icon; in Step 2, happy or angry
   faces were presented as targets in matrices of pictures of neutral faces
   that functioned as distractors. Participants were more prompted to
   respond Yes than No to the relation between the WhatsApp icon and happy
   facial expressions in IRAP trials, and showed ambivalent bias to the
   Messenger icon. Regarding the visual search performance, participants'
   were faster to find the WhatsApp target than to find the Messenger
   target. In addition, they were faster to find the happy targets than the
   angry targets. Results from the current study corroborate the hypothesis
   that the stimulus orienting function may play an important role on IRAP
   performance and, as a result, are supportive to the Differential
   Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model.},

Abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a
   measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics
   of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses
   the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research
   focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published
   IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual
   analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance
   effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is
   significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc
   explanation provided in a previously published article, the first
   experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior
   experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The
   results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who
   reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous
   experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In
   the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the
   stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The
   effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type
   dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of
   stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the
   IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer
   observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led
   inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved
   in producing IRAP effects-the differential arbitrarily applicable
   relational responding effects (DAARRE) model-which is presented in the
   General Discussion.},

Abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) assesses the
   relative strength of derived relational responding. A growing body of
   IRAP research has focused on assessing verbal relations pertaining to
   the self and others. This preliminary study sought to determine the
   feasibility of using matched pictures of self and of others across two
   IRAPs (N=32). Both the self- and other-IRAPs also presented pictures of
   pens as the contrast category. The results of the IRAPs were broadly
   consistent with common-sense expectations. That is, participants
   confirmed more readily than they denied that a picture of a face was a
   face and that a picture of a pen was a pen. They also denied more
   readily than confirmed that a picture of a pen was a face and that a
   picture of a face was a pen. No significant differences in the sizes of
   the individual trial type effects, or differences among those effects,
   emerged between the two (self and other) IRAPs. However, two key
   differential trial type effects did emerge for both IRAPs, which relate
   directly to recent and on-going conceptual developments surrounding the
   IRAP and the analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable
   relational responding in general. These developments are considered and

Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Under the rubric of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), researchers have
   investigated the role of deictic relational responding in the analysis
   of self in relation to others, place, and time, primarily through the
   use of an extended developmental protocol (Barnes-Holmes, 2001). In a
   move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational
   responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding
   regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological
   Record, 66, 243-252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was
   to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension
   involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to
   self was involved, only responding to others. The results from
   Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four
   trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment
   involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud
   procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all
   four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for
   both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model
   is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects
   that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the
   read-aloud procedure.},

Abstract = {This study extended previous research on the effect of education and
   communication on anti-autism bias and stigmatization, using the Implicit
   Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an assessment tool and
   employing undergraduates as participants. Experiment 1 examined the
   effect of a simple video and text-based educational intervention on
   attitudes towards autism, as assessed both using the IRAP and various
   explicit measures. Participants received either an educational
   video-text combination or a control video-text combination before
   exposure to the assessments. Findings showed positive responding towards
   both normally developing and autism spectrum individuals across both
   conditions on both the IRAP and the explicit measures. Experiment 2
   investigated the effects of two different types of online video-based
   narrative regarding autism, one negatively oriented and the other
   positively oriented, on both implicit and explicit responding. Findings
   suggested that the negative video affected both implicit and explicit
   responding, albeit in different ways. Responding on the IRAP showed a
   stronger pro-normally developing bias whereas explicit responding showed
   a stronger anti-autism bias. Implications and possible future directions
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The current study investigated the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable
   relational responding involving emotional pictographs (emojis) used in
   electronic messages by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure (IRAP). College students (N = 41) were trained to establish
   two classes of equivalent stimuli, each comprising a happy or an angry
   emoji, and three pseudo-words that presumably became symbols of the
   emotional pictographs. In a subsequent IRAP test, combinations of
   symbols (labels) and emojis (targets) generated four trial-types (with
   the consistent response within parentheses): happy symbol-happy emoji
   (true); happy symbol-negative emoji (false) negative symbol-happy emoji
   (false); and negative symbol-negative emoji (true), referred to as trial
   types 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A positive score occurred only for
   trial-type 1 {[}happy symbol-happy emoji (true)]. Scores for trial-types
   2 and 4 were close to zero, and the score for trial-type 3 {[}negative
   symbol-happy emoji (false)] was negative. This negative D-IRAP score
   means that participants were faster to respond true than false for the
   combination of negative symbol and happy emoji. These results are
   discussed in terms of the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational
   Responding Effects (DAARRE) model. It is hypothesized that the orienting
   and evoking (functional) properties of the positive target stimulus
   (happy emoji) and the positive response option (true) had a stronger
   bearing on participants' responding in trial type 3 than the relation
   between the label and target stimuli presented in this trial. We argue
   that the current study provides an empirical demonstration of a
   dissonant target trial type effect (DTTTE) that appeared to counter
   equivalence relations trained within the experimental session and
   discuss implications for IRAP research.},

Abstract = {Rule-governed behavior and derived stimulus relations have always shared
   strong conceptual links within behavior analysis. However, experimental
   analysis linking the two domains remains limited. The current study
   consisted of three experiments that aimed to continue to bridge this
   experimental gap. The first experiment sought to establish the extent to
   which a training version of the implicit relational assessment procedure
   (IRAP) could be used to establish and successfully reverse
   experimentally established derived relations. The results suggested that
   the Training IRAP could successfully produce derived reversals.
   Experiments 2 and 3 explored the extent to which reversed derived
   relations would control rule-governed behavior when the contingencies
   for rule-following competed with the rule. In Experiment 2, the task
   contingencies were immediately in opposition to the (reversed) derived
   rule, and participants generally responded in accordance with the task
   contingencies, rather than the rule. In Experiment 3, the task
   contingencies were initially rule-consistent before a contingency
   reversal that later made them rule-inconsistent. Here evidence of
   rule-persistence emerged. The results of the research are considered
   within the context of a recent framework that has emerged out of RFT for
   analyzing the dynamics involved in derived relational responding.},

Abstract = {Medical students are at a disproportionate risk for experiencing
   burnout, making management of burnout a critical skill to teach in
   medical education. If left unmanaged, students may develop maladaptive
   coping strategies as well as substance misuse, suicidal ideation, and
   poorer quality patient care. This study examined the impact of
   Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) as a burnout management
   curriculum with medical students at a western U.S. medical school.
   Participants (n = 281) completed measures pertaining to psychological
   flexibility (i.e., the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II; AAQ-II)
   and burnout (i.e., the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; IRAP).
   Assessments were collected at three time points over the first two years
   of medical school. ACT was provided between Time 1 and 2, and not
   between Time 2 and 3. Results demonstrated statistically significant
   improvements, specifically for students starting medical school with
   clinically relevant levels of distress on the AAQ-II (n = 53).
   Positivity bias and negativity bias were measured with a burnout themed
   Modified-IRAP (MD-IRAP). Positivity bias maintained across all three
   time points, despite an increase in negativity bias. Implications for
   teaching psychological flexibility as a burnout management tool in
   higher education and healthcare systems will be discussed.},

Abstract = {Research on self-determination theory has typically relied on explicit
   measures when examining the concept of competence need satisfaction. As
   a result, we know relatively little about competence need satisfaction
   that arises under conditions of automaticity. Across four studies, we
   developed and validated implicit measures of competence need
   satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the
   implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit
   relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these
   studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or
   moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also
   unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be
   reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but
   modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together,
   these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the
   competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need
   satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence.
   Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is
   needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low
   reliability of the IRAP.},

Abstract = {The feasibility of implicitly assessing medical student burnout was
   explored, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to
   measure longitudinal student burnout over the first two years of medical
   school and directly comparing it with an existing explicit measure of
   burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory; MBI). Three successive cohorts of
   medical students completed both implicit and explicit measures of
   burnout at several time points during their first two years of medical
   school. Both assessments were conducted via the internet within a
   one-week period during the first week of medical school, the end of the
   first year of medical school, and the end of the second year, though not
   all cohorts were able to complete the assessments at all time points.
   Mixed linear models were used to compare the two measures directly, as
   well as to evaluate changes over time in each measure separately.
   Minimal correspondence was observed between the implicit and explicit
   measures of burnout on a within-subject basis. However, when analyzed
   separately, all subscales of both measures detected significant change
   over time in the direction of greater levels of burnout, particularly
   during the first year of medical school. These results provide
   preliminary evidence the IRAP is able to assess implicit attitudes
   related to burnout among medical students, though additional research is
   needed. The IRAP detected consistent improvements in positive implicit
   attitudes toward medical training during students' second year of
   medical school, which was not detected by the MBI. Possible implications
   of these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {The mapping relationship between social status and horizontal space
   (left/right) in Chinese culture has a long history. In order to explore
   the representation pattern of horizontal spatial metaphor of social
   status in Chinese culture, this study introduced two direct
   measurements, implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) paradigm,
   and spatial placement task to evaluate the mapping of social status to
   horizontal space. A total of 144 Chinese undergraduates participated in
   the research, wherein they were asked to place certain words indicating
   social status in either left or right box before or after the IRAP
   computer test. The results from the two measurements consistently showed
   that the mode of HIGH SOCIAL STATUS-LEFT and LOW SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT
   (HLLR) had an advantage over HIGH SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT and LOW SOCIAL
   STATUS-LEFT (HRLL), implying that the representation pattern of
   horizontal spatial metaphor of social status for the Chinese is HIGH
   SOCIAL STATUS-LEFT and LOW SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT. However, the result
   convergence of the two measurements was not high, which suggests that
   embodiment effect has multiple characteristics and new specific
   experimental paradigms should be created to measure it.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The research investigated the contextual effects of mood on implicit
   measures of `wanting more' as a proxy of materialism and investigated
   the basic verbal processes underpinning this behaviour. Sixty university
   students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to
   either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n= 19) mood
   induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)
   examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires
   assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS),
   materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative
   affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP,
   shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad)
   compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were
   interpreted as an implicit bias towards `wanting more'. Compared to the
   neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition
   demonstrated an increased bias towards `wanting less' (p = .028).
   Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative
   affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with
   an implicit bias towards `wanting more' (r(s)'s ranging from - .455 to
   -. 565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of
   materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards
   wanting less (r(s) = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary
   support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of `wanting more'
   as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may
   influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame
   Theory (RFT) perspective.},

Abstract = {Previous research on mock-jury trials has shown an explicit
   attractiveness bias in participant attributes of innocence. This study
   used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure
   attractiveness-bias in implicit evaluations of innocence or guilt with a
   sample of 46 college students. Alternate IRAP trial-blocks required
   participants to affirm relations consistent and inconsistent with
   attractiveness bias (attractive-innocent/unattractive guilty versus
   unattractive-innocent/ attractiveguilty). Faster responding across
   consistent trial-blocks was interpreted in terms of implicit stereotype.
   Participants' beliefs about the importance of their own appearances were
   examined using the Beliefs about Appearances Scale (BAAS) and explicit
   attractiveness ratings for the IRAP photographic stimuli were measured
   using Likert scales; analysis examined relationships between these
   beliefs and IRAP scores. Results revealed statistically signifi cant
   attractiveness bias for both male and female participants; specifically,
   both a pro-attractiveness and anti-unattractive bias. Findings are
   discussed regarding research in implicit evaluations of innocence or

Title = {Implicit Attitudes to Female Body Shape in Spanish Women With High and
   Low Body Dissatisfaction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Research on implicit attitudes to body image has grown substantially in
   recent years. The extant evidence reveals an implicit weight bias in the
   general population that has generally been interpreted in terms of
   anti-fat attitudes. However, research with the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) shows that this bias appears to be driven by
   pro-slim rather than anti-fat implicit attitudes. Besides, the only IRAP
   study of this sort conducted in Spain found no evidence of such implicit
   weight bias (with similarly positive attitudes to thinness and fatness).
   Given the existing differences in body dissatisfaction (BD) among
   diverse cultural contexts, we predicted that discrepancies in findings
   about implicit weight bias might be related to differences in BD amongst
   the samples in the different studies. This study explores whether women
   with extreme scores in BD (High vs. Low) show different patterns of
   attitudes to female body shape. Spanish female college students with
   extreme scores in the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ: high >= 104,
   percentile 80; low <= 52, percentile 20) completed an IRAP with pictures
   of overweight and underweight women as target stimuli and the words
   pleasant and unpleasant as labels. Participants also completed explicit
   ratings to the same stimuli and clinically relevant measures of body
   image related distress. Results showed an implicit weight bias only for
   women high in BD. While both groups showed equally positive implicit
   attitudes to thinness, only women with low BD showed implicit positive
   attitudes to fatness (and hence no bias). In turn, both groups presented
   a clear pro-thin/anti-fat explicit bias with positive ratings for
   underweight pictures and negative ratings for overweight pictures. The
   latter were stronger for the high BD group. Therefore, between-group
   differences were mainly driven by differences in attitudes to fatness
   (both implicit and explicit). Both implicit and explicit attitudes to
   fatness independently predicted eating disorders symptoms and other
   clinically relevant measures. These results are discussed in terms of
   their clinical implications.},

Abstract = {Studies on equivalence relations have suggested that abstract symbols
   might acquire emotional functions when related to facial expressions.
   The present study aimed to investigate the transformation of emotional
   functions from facial expressions of fear and of happiness to abstract
   stimuli via equivalence relations. A delayed matching-to-sample task
   established two equivalence classes between facial expressions of
   emotions and nonsense abstract stimuli: A1(Fear)-B1-C1-D1;
   A2(Happiness)-B2-C2-D2. After relational training (AB, AC, CD) and
   equivalence tests (BD, DB), the participants evaluated the meaning of
   one nonsense stimulus from each class (D1 and D2) by means of a semantic
   differential and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP).
   Results from both the semantic differential and the IRAP supported the
   conclusion that the emotional functions of the faces, in terms of fear
   and happiness, had transformed via the equivalence classes to the D
   stimuli. Results are discussed in terms of the dynamics of arbitrarily
   applicable relational responding.},

Title = {Emotional Faces in Symbolic Relations: A Happiness Superiority Effect
   Involving the Equivalence Paradigm},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {The stimulus equivalence paradigm presented operational criteria to
   identify symbolic functions in observable behaviors. When humans match
   dissimilar stimuli (e.g., words to pictures), equivalence relations
   between those stimuli are likely to be demonstrated through behavioral
   tests derived from the logical properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and
   transitivity. If these properties are confirmed, one can say that those
   stimuli are members of an equivalence class in which each member is
   substitutable for the others. A number of studies, which have
   established equivalence classes comprised of arbitrary stimuli and
   pictures of faces expressing emotions, have found that valences of the
   faces affect the relatedness of equivalent stimuli. Importantly, several
   studies reported stronger relational strength in equivalence classes
   containing happy faces than in equivalence classes containing angry
   faces. The processes that may account for this higher degree of
   relatability of happy faces are not yet known. The current study
   investigated the dynamics of the symbolic relational responding
   involving facial expressions of different emotions by means of the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were 186
   undergraduate students who were taught to establish two equivalence
   classes, each comprising pictures of faces expressing either happiness
   (for one class) or a negative emotion (for another class), and
   meaningless words. The IRAP effect was taken as an index for the
   relational strength established between equivalent stimuli in the
   different equivalence classes. The dynamics of arbitrary relational
   responding in the course of the four IRAP trial types revealed that the
   participants exhibited a stronger IRAP effect in trials involving the
   happy faces and a weaker IRAP effect in trials involving the negative
   faces. These findings indicate that the happy faces had higher impact on
   the symbolic relational responding than the negative faces. The
   potential role played by the orienting function of happy vs. negative
   faces is discussed. By considering other studies that also reported a
   happiness superiority effect in other contexts, we present converging
   evidence for the prioritization of positive affect in emotional,
   categorical, and symbolic processing.},

Abstract = {The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is an assessment
   tool designed to measure one's learning history with respect to
   preexisting verbal relations (Barnes-Holmes, Hayden, Barnes-Holmes, \&
   Stewart,2008). Responses to stimuli are regarded as implicit because
   they are measured with respect to the associated response latencies and
   accuracy, or brief and immediate relational responding (BIRRs; Hughes \&
   Barnes-Holmes,2013, p. 104). This study used the modified (MD) IRAP to
   select stimuli that were presented in motivational statements in a
   simulated work task to increase cooperative and conformity responding.
   Participants came into contact with customized motivational statements
   promoting cooperative and conformity responding in conditions with a
   competing pay-for-performance contingency using an alternating
   treatments design. Results showed that motivational statements
   temporarily increased cooperative and conformity responding. Moreover,
   those participants identified as having a stronger history with
   particular stimuli, as identified in the MD IRAP, chose to cooperate and
   conform at higher and more sustained rates. The coherence between
   implicit responding, as demonstrated in the MD IRAP, and explicit
   responding, as demonstrated in the simulated work task, and the
   implications it has on prosocial behaviors will be discussed.},

Abstract = {A recently published article reported a particular pattern of responding
   that has been observed on the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP), referred to as a Single-Trial-Type-Dominance-Effect (STTDE;
   Finn, Barnes-Holmes, \& McEnteggart in The Psychological Record, 68(1),
   11-25, 2018). To account for the phenomenon, the Differential
   Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model of
   IRAP performance was proposed. The DAARRE model predicts the STTDE in
   terms of an overlap in the functional properties of the label, target,
   and response-option stimuli presented within an IRAP. This article
   presents an initial attempt at engineering a STTDE within an
   experimental session. Forty participants were exposed to a series of
   training procedures and IRAPs. The training procedures consisted of a
   series of trials that aimed to establish a ``True{''} function for a
   picture stimulus that was subsequently presented in the IRAP;
   participants were then exposed to an IRAP in which participants were
   required to respond ``True{''} on a specific trial-type that presented
   that picture. Consistent with the DAARRE model, the STTDE emerged for
   the predicted trial-type, with analyses at both the group and individual
   participant level supporting this conclusion. The implications of the
   findings for future research on analyzing the dynamics of arbitrarily
   applicable relational responding are discussed.},

Abstract = {Two studies are presented that involved exploring four different
   versions of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to
   target self-relevant stimulus relations. Experiment 1 employed stimuli
   from previous research that used the IRAP to target stimulus relations
   pertaining to self, and self-esteem in particular. Experiment 2 aimed to
   explore the use of different types of stimuli (i.e., pictures as well as
   words), that again focused on self-related stimulus relations, and their
   potential correlations with measures of self-esteem and psychological
   distress. Experiment 1 yielded broadly similar findings to those
   reported previously. Experiment 2 showed that only one trial type from
   the IRAP using pictures depicting success versus failure correlated with
   the measures of self-esteem and psychological distress; none of the
   remaining 11 trial types across the three IRAPs yielded any significant
   correlations. The current findings may be seen as relatively progressive
   when presented in the context of a theoretical model that may be used,
   albeit in a post-hoc manner, to interpret the specific IRAP response
   patterns obtained in the current and previously published research. In
   particular, an in-depth RFT conceptual analysis of the findings using a
   recently proposed model of IRAP effects is presented.},

   interactive computerized teaching program, the Teacher-Implicit
   Relational Assessment Programme (T-IRAP; Kilroe, Murphy, Barnes-Holmes,
   \& Barnes-Holmes, Behavioral Development Bulletin, 19(2), 60-80, 2014).
   Relational skills targeted were coordination (same/different), with
   nonarbitrary and arbitrary stimuli. Participants' relational learning
   outcomes were compared in terms of speed of responding and accuracy
   (percentage correct) in T-IRAP and TT conditions. Results showed
   significantly increased speed for all five participants during T-IRAP
   teaching across all procedures; however, accuracy was only marginally
   increased during T-IRAP. Pre- and posttraining comparison of participant
   scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (Dunn \&
   Dunn, 2007), and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (Kaufman \&
   Kaufman, 1990) was conducted. An improvement in raw scores on both
   measures was evident for one participant who learned complex arbitrary
   relations; no changes were shown for participants who learned only basic
   nonarbitrary relations.},

Abstract = {Under a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) framework, researchers have
   investigated the role of deictic relational responding
   (perspective-taking) in the analysis of self in relation to others,
   place, and time. The aim of the current research was to develop IRAPs
   that targeted deictic relational responding with regard to the mental
   states of self and others. This was pursued in a series of experiments
   that employed a novel version of the IRAP, known as the Natural
   Language-IRAP (NL-IRAP). The use of the NL-IRAP allowed for the
   presentation of relatively complex statements that required participants
   to infer the thoughts or beliefs of others on a trial-by-trial basis
   within the IRAP. Across a sequence of six experiments, a self-focused
   IRAP required participants to respond to both positive and negative
   statements about themselves, whereas an other-focused IRAP required
   participants to respond to similar statements about others. Experiments
   1 and 2 investigated perspective-taking with regard to an unspecified
   other. Experiments 3-6 investigated perspective-taking with regard to a
   specified other, with the specified relationship between self and other
   manipulated across experiments. The results of Experiments 1 and 2
   indicated that the other-focused IRAP produced overall bias scores that
   were significantly stronger than responding to the self-focused IRAP. It
   is interesting that nonsignificant differences were recorded across
   Experiments 3-6 when other was specified. The findings obtained across
   the six studies highlight potentially important limitations in the use
   of the NL-IRAP as a measure of perspective-taking.},

Abstract = {Background: Family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated
   with increased dementia-risk.
   Objective: The Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) is a
   prospective longitudinal study of asymptomatic middle-aged offspring of
   AD patients (family history positive; FH+) and controls (whose parents
   have aged without dementia; FH-) aimed to unravel the contribution of
   midlife factors to future cognitive decline and dementia. Here we
   present the study design, methods, and baseline characteristics.
   Methods: Participants are members of the Maccabi Health Services, 40-65
   years of age, with exquisitely detailed laboratory, medical diagnoses
   and medication data available in the Maccabi electronic medical records
   since 1998. Data collected through IRAP include genetic,
   sociodemographic, cognitive, brain imaging, lifestyle, and
   health-related characteristics at baseline and every three years
   thereafter.
   Results: Currently IRAP has 483 participants {[}mean age 54.95 (SD =
   6.68) and 64.8\% (n = 313) women], 379 (78.5\%) FH+, and 104 (21.5\%)
   FH-. Compared to FH-, FH+ participants were younger (p =0.011), more
   often males (p = 0.003) and with a higher prevalence of the APOE E4
   allele carriers (32.9\% FH+, 22\% FH-; p = 0.040). Adjusting for age,
   sex, and education, FH+ performed worse than FH- in global cognition (p
   = 0.027) and episodic memory (p = 0.022).
   Conclusion: Lower cognitive scores and higher rates of the APOE E4
   allele carriers among the FH+ group suggest that FH ascertainment is
   good. The combination of long-term historical health-related data
   available through Maccabi with the multifactorial information collected
   through IRAP will potentially enable development of dementia-prevention
   strategies already in midlife, a critical period in terms of risk factor
   exposure and initiation of AD-neuropathology.},

Title = {Assessing the Effects of Motivative Augmentals, Pay-For-Performance, and
   Implicit Verbal Responding on Cooperation},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-66},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Motivative augmentals are rules or statements that temporarily change
   the effectiveness of a consequence, similar to establishing operations
   for nonverbal consequences (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, \& Roche, 2001). Many
   communications by an organization's leadership may function as such and
   alter the function of stimuli in the workplace, which in turn may
   influence employee behaviors (Houmanfar \& Rodrigues, Journal of Applied
   Radical Behavior Analysis, N1, 22-27, 2012). There is a lack of
   experimental research regarding this, however, particularly under
   different organizational pay systems (i.e., financial contingencies),
   which have been repeatedly shown to influence performance (e.g., Gupta
   \& Shaw, Compensation and Benefits Review, 30(2), 26-32, 1998; Locke,
   Feren, McCaleb, Shaw, \& Denny, 1980). The current study sought to
   compare the two by measuring the effect of motivational statements on
   individual versus cooperative responding under two different
   pay-for-performance contingencies in an organizational analogue. Stimuli
   for the motivational statements were selected utilizing an Implicit
   Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) with one group of participants,
   and these statements were then tested under piece-rate and profit-share
   conditions with a second group of participants in a counterbalanced
   reversal design. Results indicated that the financial contingencies had
   more of an effect on responding, but that motivational statements
   influenced behavior as well. In particular, motivational statements
   affected whether a participant chose to cooperate or behave individually
   more under financially neutral conditions (i.e., profit share) when
   there was no financial cost for doing so. As such, organizations can
   utilize memos or speeches to increase performance, but it is important
   for the content to align with financial contingencies in order to
   maximize performance.},

Title = {Identification of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) in the rat

Journal = {BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1704},
Pages = {40-46},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {A local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been postulated in the pineal
   gland. In addition to angiotensin II (Ang II), other active metabolites
   have been described. In this study, we aimed to investigate a role for
   Ang IV in melatonin synthesis and the presence of its proposed
   (IRAP)/AT(4) receptor (insulin-regulated aminopeptidase) in the pineal
   gland.
   The effect of Ang IV on melatonin synthesis was investigated in vitro
   using isolated pinealocytes. IRAP protein expression and activity were
   evaluated by Western blot and fluorimetry using
   Leu-4Me-beta-naphthylamide as a substrate. Melatonin was analyzed by
   HPLC, calcium content by confocal microscopy and cAMP by immunoassay.
   Ang IV significantly augmented the NE-induced melatonin synthesis to a
   similar degree as that achieved by Ang This Ang IV effect in
   pinealocytes appears to be mediated by an increase in the intracellular
   calcium content but not by cAMP. The (IRAP)/AT(4) expression and
   activity were identified in the pineal gland, which were significantly
   higher in membrane fractions than in soluble fractions. Ang IV
   significantly reduced IRAP activity in the pineal membrane fractions.
   The main findings of the present study are as follows: (1) Ang IV
   potentiates NE-stimulated melatonin production in pinealocytes, (2) the
   (TRAP)/AT(4) receptor is present in the rat pineal gland, and (3) Ang IV
   inhibits IRAP activity and increases pinealocytes {[}Ca2+](i).
   We conclude that Ang IV is an important component of RAS and modulates
   melatonin synthesis in the rat pineal gland.},

Abstract = {Gender stereotypes affect both women and men from childhood. Whereas men
   may be more often associated with STEM careers, women tend to be
   associated with nurturing and caring careers. The present research used
   an explicit scale and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure to
   investigate how gender-career relational patterns could vary for
   Brazilian college students according to their gender and career. Both
   instruments included the names of careers stereotypically regarded as
   ``male{''} or ``female{''} and words indicating gender. Participants
   were divided into four groups (men and women in STEM and the
   humanities). A significant pm-male-STEM bias emerged for all groups,
   except the STEM-female group, the only group to show a significant
   pm-female-STEM bias (p < .05) and a significant difference from the
   other three groups. A significant implicit pro-men-male career bias was
   mostly more substantial among male students. In the explicit scales,
   participants tended to show a more neutral evaluation (not classifying
   careers as ``male{''} or ``female{''}). Correlations were found between
   explicit evaluations for male careers and the implicit trial type
   ``women-male careers,{''} indicating that the more a career was
   explicitly evaluated as male, the more easily it was related with
   ``women{''} as false at the implicit level.},

Title = {Models of Cognition and Their Applications in Behavioral Economics: A
   Conceptual Framework for Nudging Derived From Behavior Analysis and
   Relational Frame Theory},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {This paper puts forward a rounder conceptual model for interpreting
   short- and long-term effects of choice behavior. As a further
   development of dual-process theory, Kahneman (2003) distinguished
   between intuition and reasoning, which served as the respective
   precursors of the cognitive processing systems 1 and 2. We maintain that
   they reflect the more rigorous distinction between brief and immediate
   and extended and elaborated relational responding, which may be
   reinterpreted through an analysis of their functional properties.
   Repertoires of relational responding are offered by the
   multi-dimensional multi-level model. Specifically, we provide a
   conceptual account of how nudging, or the manipulation of environmental
   contingencies, works on the creation and modification of relational
   framing. Educative nudges, or boosts, are a subset of nudges that may
   more easily maintain target choice behavior in the future. The central
   role of verbal behavior is essential toward formulating rules, which
   inform and guide choice behavior over time. Although nudges are
   traditionally regarded as System 1-steered aspects, they are herein
   regarded as cues for responding to relational frames, which may induce
   System 2-steered aspects. We suggest adopting the implicit relational
   assessment procedure (IRAP) to inform how coherent and immediate
   responding to novel relational responding may occur in the presence of
   choice behavior. Several examples are included to support the claim of
   encompassing relational responding and choice behavior. We address the
   instances of consumer behavior, stereotypy and prejudices, eating
   behavior, and overcoming cognitive biases. The conclusions depict a
   promising way forward for the study of choice: an improved model for
   interpreting and overcoming human errors, due to changes in the
   contingencies of behavior.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in relational frame theory (RFT) have outlined a
   number of key variables of potential importance when analyzing the
   dynamics involved in derived relational responding. Recent research has
   begun to explore the impact of a number of these variables on persistent
   rule-following, namely, levels of derivation and coherence. However, no
   research to date has systematically examined the impact of coherence on
   persistent rule-following at varying levels of derivation. Across two
   experiments, the impact of coherence (manipulated through the systematic
   use of performance feedback) was explored on persistent rule-following
   when derivation was relatively low (Exp. 1) and high (Exp. 2). A
   training protocol based on the implicit relational assessment procedure
   (IRAP) was used to establish novel combinatorially entailed relations
   that manipulated the feedback provided on the untrained, derived
   relations (A-C) for five blocks of trials in Experiment1and one block of
   trials in Experiment2. One of these relations was then inserted into the
   rule for responding on a subsequent contingency-switching
   match-to-sample task to assess rule persistence. While no significant
   differences were found in Experiment1, the provision or non-provision of
   feedback had a significant differential impact on rule persistence in
   Experiment2. These differences, and the subtle complexities that appear
   to be involved in persistent rule-following in the face of reversed
   reinforcement contingencies, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Stigmatizing attitudes about individuals with a Substance Use Disorder
   (SUD) are known to contribute to the individual's psychological problems
   and response to treatment. Providers of SUD treatment services have been
   shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and
   these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD
   stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit
   attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures.
   However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations
   of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to
   predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively
   underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine
   implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact
   of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to
   write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed
   that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure
   in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure
   outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write
   letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit
   attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of
   individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing
   implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD
   treatment and therapist training.},

Abstract = {Rule-governed behavior and derived relational responding have both been
   identified as important variables in human learning. Recent developments
   in the relational frame theory (RFT) have outlined a number of key
   variables of potential importance when analyzing the dynamics involved
   in derived relational responding. Recent research has explored the
   impact of one of these variables, level of derivation, on persistent
   rule-following and implicated another, coherence, as possibly important.
   However, no research to date has examined the impact of coherence on
   persistent rule-following directly. Across two experiments, coherence
   was manipulated through the systematic use of performance feedback, and
   its impact was examined on persistent rule-following. A training
   procedure based on the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP)
   was used to establish novel combinatorially entailed relations that
   manipulated the feedback provided on the trained relations (A-B and B-C)

   task to assess rule persistence. While no significant differences were
   found in Experiment 1, the provision or non-provision of feedback had a
   significant differential impact on rule-persistence in Experiment 2.
   Specifically, participants in the Feedback group resurged back to the
   original rule for significantly more responses after demonstrating
   contingency-sensitive responding than did the No-Feedback group, after
   the contingency reversal. The results highlight the subtle complexities
   that appear to be involved in persistent rule-following in the face of
   reversed reinforcement contingencies.},

Title = {Beyond an Associative Conception of Automatic Self-Evaluations: Applying

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {According to dual-process models, implicit self-esteem (SE) is based on
   automatic self-associations that can be measured with indirect
   techniques based on an associative conception of implicit cognition
   (e.g., Implicit Association Test; IAT). However, alternative theoretical
   proposals (e.g., relational frame theory; RFT) propose that implicit SE
   might not be based on automatic self-associations, but on implicit
   propositional self-evaluations that can be captured only with
   nonassociative implicit measures (e.g., Implicit Relational Assessment
   Procedure; IRAP). In the present study, both reliability and validity of
   a new propositional measure of implicit self-esteem (relational
   responding task; RRT) were assessed, and compared with the SE-IAT and
   with two self-report scales of self-esteem. In the first study, two
   alternative self-esteem RRTs (SE-RRT and RSE-RRT) were administered
   along with a SE-IAT and other scales, to assess reliability and validity
   issues. The results showed: 1) acceptable, though not optimal,
   reliability for both RRTs; 2) an adequate support for convergent
   validity, with significant correlations between implicit and explicit
   measures of SE; 3) the criterion validity was supported for the RSE-RRT
   (with significant correlations with all theoretically linked scales),
   although only partially supported for the SE-RRT (with a significant
   correlation only with depression; 4) RRTs were not significantly
   correlated with impression management and self-deception; and 5)
   incremental validity of implicit propositional SE on depression,
   controlling for automatic SE associations and explicit self-esteem. In a
   second study, it was experimentally demonstrated that SE-RRT showed
   levels of ``fakeability{''} similar to a classical implicit self-esteem
   measure like the SE-IAT, and considerably lower than SE scales.},

Title = {Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase inhibitor-mediated increases in

Volume = {153},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Ethyl2-acetylamino-7-hydroxy-4-pyridin-3-yl-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate
   (HFI-419), the benzopyran-based inhibitor of insulin-regulated
   aminopeptidase (IRAP), has previously been shown to improve spatial
   working and recognition memory in rodents. However, the mechanism of its
   cognitive-enhancing effect remains unknown. There is a close correlation
   between dendritic spine density and learning in vivo and several studies
   suggest that increases in neuronal glucose uptake and/or alterations to
   the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may improve memory and
   increase dendritic spine density. We aimed to identify the potential
   mechanism by which HFI-419 enhances memory by utilizing rat primary
   cultures of hippocampal cells. Alterations to dendritic spine density
   were assessed in the presence of varying concentrations of HFI-419 at
   different stages of hippocampal cell development. In addition, glucose
   uptake and changes to spine density were assessed in the presence of
   indinavir, an inhibitor of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT(4)), or the
   matrix metalloprotease inhibitor CAS 204140-01-2. We confirmed that
   inhibition of IRAP activity with HFI-419 enhanced spatial working memory
   in rats, and determined that this enhancement may be driven by
   GLUT(4)-mediated changes to dendritic spine density. We observed that
   IRAP inhibition increased dendritic spine density prior to peak
   dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons, and that spine formation was
   inhibited when GLUT(4)-mediated glucose uptake was blocked. In addition,
   during the peak phase of dendritic spine growth, the effect of IRAP
   inhibition on enhancement of dendritic spine density resulted
   specifically in an increase in the proportion of mushroom/stubby-like
   spines, a morphology associated with memory and learning. Moreover,
   these spines were deemed to be functional based on their expression of
   the pre-synaptic markers vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and synapsin.
   Overall, or findings suggest that IRAP inhibitors may facilitate memory
   by increasing hippocampal dendritic spine density via a GLUT(4)-mediated
   mechanism.},

Title = {Decreased behavioural and neurochemical effects of angiotensin IV
   following prenatal alcohol exposure in the mouse},
Journal = {NEUROPEPTIDES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Angiotensin N (ang IV) is known to improve learning and memory in animal
   models but the mechanism is unclear. We have previously demonstrated sex
   differences in the pro-cognitive effects of ang IV, and that prenatal
   alcohol exposure (PAE) abolishes these effects. This study aimed to
   explore a possible mechanism underlying the sex differences and the
   effects of PAE in male mice.
   Mouse breeding harems received 5\% ethanol in drinking water throughout
   pregnancy and lactation in a two bottle schedule. The effects of ang IV
   were assessed in offspring at 4 months of age using the open field test,
   novel object recognition test and elevated plus maze. Aminopeptidase
   activity of brain insulin-regulated amino peptidase (IRAP), a putative
   target of ang IV, was determined.
   As seen in a previous similar study, ang IV administered immediately
   after the second training trial significantly improved novel object
   recognition 24 h later in male mice but not female. PAE abolished this
   pro cognitive effect in males. PAE also increased anxiety-like behaviour
   in male but not female offspring. Ang IV decreased the aminopeptidase
   activity of brain IRAP in control male, but not female, mice; PAE
   abolished this inhibitory effect.
   Ang IV improved memory consolidation in male but not female mice and PAE
   abolished this effect in the males. While the effects of PAE may be
   related to increased anxiety; ang IV decreased the aminopeptidase
   activity in male but not female mice and PAE abolished this inhibitory
   effect. The results therefore suggest that improvements in learning and
   memory induced by peripheral administration of ang IV correlate with a
   reduction of the enzyme activity of IRAP. This is the first
   demonstration that ang IV administered peripherally can induce long-term
   (24 h) changes in IRAP function which are probably not simple
   competitive inhibition and the first demonstration that PAE alters IRAP
   activity.},

Title = {Testing the neurocognitive framework for regulation expectation: The
   relationship between actual/ideal self-esteem and proactive/reactive
   autonomic stress regulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: According to the Neurocognitive Framework for
   Regulation Expectation (NFRE), actual and ideal self-esteem are related
   to how individuals anticipate and respond to a stressful event. Based on
   this framework, we investigated whether in individuals with low ideal
   self-esteem (moderator), a positive relationship between actual
   self-esteem and reactive autonomic regulation would be mediated by the
   amount of anticipatory autonomic regulation.
   Methods: Forty-five healthy females prepared a speech (i.e.,
   anticipation) and performed it in front of a camera (i. e., stressor).
   Actual and ideal self-esteem were measured with the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure. Anticipatory and reactive autonomic stress
   regulation were indexed by heart rate variability, and affective
   responses were assessed via self-report.
   Results: Results were in line with predictions based on the NFRE: when
   ideal self-esteem was low, higher actual self-esteem was associated with
   higher reactive autonomic regulation, and this association was mediated
   by higher anticipatory autonomic regulation.
   Limitations: Because only female undergraduates were recruited,
   replication within a more heterogeneous sample is necessary to further
   generalize these findings.
   Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis, based on the NFRE,
   that actual and ideal self-esteem interact in predicting the
   relationship between anticipatory and reactive stress regulation, and
   are a step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying
   successful stress regulation.},

   Attitudes Toward Ethnic Minority Students Predict Preservice Teachers'
   Judgments About Achievement},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {In many educational systems, ethnic minority students score lower in
   their academic achievement, and consequently, teachers develop low
   expectations regarding this student group. Relatedly, teachers' implicit
   attitudes, explicit expectations, and causal attributions also differ
   between ethnic minority and ethnic majority students-all in a
   disadvantageous way for ethnic minority students. However, what is not
   known so far, is how attitudes and causal attributions contribute
   together to teachers' judgments. In the current study, we explored how
   implicit attitudes and causal attributions contribute to preservice
   teachers' judgments of the low educational success of an ethnic minority
   student. Results showed that both implicit attitudes and causal
   attributions predicted language proficiency and intelligence judgments.
   Negative implicit attitudes, assessed with the IRAP, and internal stable
   causal attributions led to lower judgments of language proficiency,
   whereas lower judgments of intelligence were predicted by positive
   implicit attitudes and higher judgments of intelligence by external
   stable attributions. Substantial differences in the prediction of
   judgments could be found between the IRAP and BIAT as measures of
   implicit attitudes.},

Title = {Estrogen can abolish oxytocin-induced spinal anti-hyperalgesia},
Journal = {PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Our previous study verified a sex difference of anti-hyperalgesia in
   rats and anti-allodynia in mice induced by intrathecal oxytocin (OT). In
   the model of intraplantar carrageenan-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia,
   intrathecal OT injection induced a substantial anti-hyperalgesia in male
   rats even at a low dose (0.125 nmol). In contrast, female rats only
   responded to an extremely high dose (1.25 nmol). This sex difference
   concurs with a lower expression of OT receptors and higher expression of
   insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP; OT degrading enzyme) in the
   spinal cords of female rats. In this study, we further determined the
   role of female hormones in this sex difference by using ovariectomized
   rats. Our results show that a low dose of intrathecal OT caused a
   significant anti-hyperalgesia effect in ovariectomized female rats,
   similar to that seen in male rats. Ovariectomy did not cause any change
   of paw edema except at the late stage of convalescence when compared
   with the sham-operated group. Ovariectomy-induced faster recovery from
   edema but did not affect the severity of hyperalgesia. Moreover, there
   was a similar amount of IRAP expression in ovariectomized and sham rats.
   When estradiol (E2) was given together with OT, OT-induced
   anti-hyperalgesia was abolished at the developmental stage of
   hyperalgesia in ovariectomized rats. These results show an inhibitory
   role of female hormones generated from ovaries (mainly estrogen) in the
   sex difference of anti-hyperalgesia induced by OT. This study suggests
   the feasibility of a novel OT-based remedy to treat hyperalgesia in men
   and in menopausal women no receiving hormonal supplements.},

Abstract = {The factors that determine the content and valence of spontaneous
   thoughts have not yet been clarified. In this study, we focused on the
   effects of bodily states and depression and anxiety traits. Participants
   performed a past/future thinking task in which three-part sentences
   including temporal cues were presented in a sequential pattern, for
   example ``in the near future/dreams/will come true{''}. We measured
   heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) to assess affective processing, and
   event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess temporal processing of
   thoughts that emerged when the temporal cue words were presented. The
   HEPs predicted thought valence irrespective of personality traits.
   Larger N400 ERPs were observed in response to past-oriented than to
   future oriented words in participants with higher levels of depression,
   whereas the opposite was the case in participants with higher social
   anxiety. Our data suggest that afferent signals modulate affective
   thought-orientations as triggers, and that individuals with depression
   and anxiety have sensitivity toward temporal information at the neural
   level.},

Abstract = {Implicit cognitive processing is theorized to have a central role in
   many forms of psychopathology. In the current review, we focus on
   implicit associations, by which we mean evaluative representations in
   memory that are difficult to control and do not require conscious
   reflection to influence affect, cognition, or behavior. We consider
   definitional and measurement challenges before examining recent
   empirical evidence for these associations in anxiety,
   obsessive-compulsive, posttraumatic stress, depressive, and alcohol use
   disorders. This examination is framed by a brief review of the ways that
   prominent models of psychopathology represent biased implicit processing
   of disorder-relevant information. We consider to what extent models
   reflect more traditional automatic/implicit versus strategic/explicit
   dual-process perspectives or reflect more recent dynamical systems
   perspectives in which mental representations are iteratively
   reprocessed, evolving continuously. Finally, we consider the future
   research needed to better understand the interactive and temporal
   dynamics of implicit cognition in psychopathology.},

Abstract = {The seminal text on relational frame theory (RFT) was published 20 years
   ago and purported to offer a single overarching behavior-analytic
   account of human language and cognition. In the years thereafter, an
   increasing number of empirical and conceptual articles, book chapters in
   edited volumes, and whole volumes devoted to the account emerged. In
   recent years, RFT has experienced a period of intense empirical and
   conceptual development, facilitated in part by a research grant awarded
   by the Flanders Science Foundation, under its Odysseus program. This
   research program aimed to advance and extend the RFT account beyond the
   rendition presented in the seminal Hayes et al. (2001) volume. The
   current article aims to provide an overview of this research program,

Abstract = {Studies suggest that fear-related responses might be acquired through
   the facial expressions of other individuals. The present study aimed to
   investigate the derived transfer of aversive functions in equivalence
   classes comprised of facial expressions of fear and happiness. A delayed
   matching-to-sample task established two equivalence classes between
   facial expressions of emotions and nonsense abstract stimuli:
   B1-A1(Fear)-C1-D1; B2-A2(Happiness)-C2-D2. After relational training
   (AB, AC, CD) and equivalence tests (BD, DB), the transfer of function
   from the faces to the D stimuli was evaluated by means of (1) a semantic
   differential, (2) an avoidance task, (3) US expectancy scale, and (4)
   valence scale. Results fromthe semantic differential indicated that D1
   and D2 had negative and positive evaluations, respectively. Fear related
   measures indicated that D1 (equivalent to fear) evoked avoidance
   responses, was highly rated on US expectancy and was negatively
   valenced; in comparison, D2 (equivalent to happy) did not evoke either
   avoidance or US expectancy and was positively valenced. These findings
   indicate that the participation of fearful faces in equivalence classes
   leads to derived fear, including derived avoidance responses.},

Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {36-46},

Abstract = {The effects of rules on human behaviour have long been identified as
   important in the psychological literature. The increasing importance of
   the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR),
   with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within
   Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous
   research has suggested may differentially impact persistent
   rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to
   date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two
   experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on
   persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development:
   mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A
   Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational
   network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in
   Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of
   derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample
   (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments
   were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of
   derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly,
   however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence
   was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results
   across both experiments and their implications for future research are
   discussed.},

Title = {Measuring differential nodal distance using the function acquisition
   speed test},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {178},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that the relatedness of stimuli within the
   Function Acquisition Speed Test (FAST) methodology is sensitive to the
   learning histories of participants. For example, this method is
   sensitive to differences in the amount of baseline training provided to
   establish stimulus equivalence relations using arbitrary stimuli
   (Cummins a al., 2018a). However, it has not yet been investigated
   whether the relatedness of stimuli within the FAST varies based on
   differential nodal distances between stimuli within stimulus classes. If
   so, the FAST could serve an important adjunct assessment procedure for
   researchers who wish not only to assess the formation of stimulus
   classes using traditional methods, such as matching-to-sample, but also
   the relative relatedness of stimuli within complex stimulus classes
   (i.e., nodal distance). The current study sought to investigate this
   possibility. Participants (n = 16) were trained in the formation of two
   4-member equivalence classes consisting of arbitrary nonsense syllables.
   Following this, participants completed three FAST assessments, each of
   which probed for the relatedness of stimulus pairs of differing nodal
   distance. Group- and individuallevel analyses broadly demonstrated that
   relatedness varied as a function of nodal distances in pre-trained
   stimulus classes. However, results also highlighted some limitations of
   the FAST at the individual level.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article describes how the study of derived stimulus relations has
   provided the basis for a behavior-analytic approach to the study of
   human language and cognition in purely functional-analytic terms, with a
   focus on basic rather than applied research. The article begins with a
   brief history of the early behavior-analytic approach to human language
   and cognition, focusing on Skinner's (1957) text Verbal Behavior, his
   subsequent introduction of the concept of instructional control
   (Skinner, 1966), and Sidman's (1994) seminal research on stimulus
   equivalence relations. The article then considers how the concept of
   derived stimulus relations, as conceptualized within relational frame
   theory (Hayes et al., 2001), allowed researchers to refine and extend
   the functional approach to language and cognition in multiple ways.
   Finally, the article considers some recent conceptual and empirical
   developments that highlight how the concept of derived stimulus
   relations continues to play a key role in the behavior-analytic study of
   human language and cognition, particularly implicit cognition. In
   general, the article aims to provide a particular perspective on how the
   study of derived stimulus relations has facilitated and enhanced the
   behavior analysis of human language and cognition, particularly over the
   past 25-30 years.},

Title = {The Propositional Evaluation Paradigm: Indirect Assessment of Personal
   Beliefs and Attitudes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Identification of propositions as the core of attitudes and beliefs (De
   Houwer, 2014) has resulted in the development of implicit measures
   targeting personal evaluations of complex sentences (e.g., the IRAP or
   the RRT). Whereas their utility is uncontested, these paradigms are
   subject to limitations inherent in their block-based design, such as
   allowing assessment of only a single belief at a time. We introduce the
   Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP) for assessment of multiple
   propositional beliefs within a single experimental block. Two
   experiments provide first evidence for the PEP's validity. In Experiment
   1, endorsement of racist beliefs measured with the PEP was related to
   criterion variables such as explicit racism assessed via questionnaire
   and indicators of behavioral tendencies. Experiment 2 indicates that the
   PEP's implicit racism scores may predict actual behavior over and above
   explicit, self-report measures. Finally, Experiment 3 tested the PEP's
   applicability in the domain of hiring discrimination. Whereas general
   PEP-based gender stereotypes were not related to hiring bias, results
   suggest a possible role of female stereotypes in hiring discrimination.
   In the context of these findings, we discuss both the potential and
   possible challenges in adopting the PEP to different beliefs. In sum,
   these initial findings suggest that the PEP may offer researchers a
   reliable and easily administrable option for the indirect assessment of
   propositional evaluations.},

Title = {Tankyrase inhibition augments neuronal insulin sensitivity and glucose
   uptake via AMPK-AS160 mediated pathway},
Journal = {NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {141},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tankyrase, a member of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family,
   regulates various cellular pathways including wnt signaling, telomere
   maintenance and mitosis, has become a prime target for the development
   of cancer therapeutics. Inhibition of tankyrase, which leads to its
   increased cellular accumulation, reveal the role of tankyrase in the
   regulation of Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation and
   glucose homeostasis in peripheral insulin responsive tissues. While in
   adipocytes inhibition of tankyrase improves insulin sensitivity and
   glucose uptake, its inhibition in skeletal muscle leads to development
   of insulin resistance. Evidently further studies are required to
   determine the broader perspective of tankyrase in other cellular systems
   in regulating insulin signaling and insulin resistance. Role of
   tankyrase in neuronal tissues/cells has not been tested. In the present
   study, we investigated the effect of tankyrase inhibition in
   insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant Neuro2a cells. Here, we report
   that XAV939 treatment, a tankyrase inhibitor, improves
   insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive as well as in
   insulin-resistant neuronal cells via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
   - AKT Substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) mediated pathway without affecting
   the phosphorylation/activation of AKT. AMPK inhibition by Compound C
   repressed XAV939 treatment mediated increase in glucose uptake,
   confirming the role of tankyrase in glucose uptake via AMPK. We show for
   the first time that inhibition of tankyrase significantly improves
   glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity of insulin-resistant neuronal
   cells via AMPK-AS160 mediated pathway. Our study demonstrates new
   mechanistic insights of tankyrase mediated regulation of insulin
   sensitivity as well as glucose uptake in neuronal cells.},

   homework. Day 2 involved a second exposure to the fear-related
   verbal-rehearsal task and exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. The final day
   involved a second exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. Participants were
   randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., control, accept, or
   reduce fear). Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on
   the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. (2017). No significant
   differences between the conditions emerged on the self-report measures,
   IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the
   IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated almost exclusively in the control
   and reduce-fear conditions rather than the accept-fear condition. The
   replication of results reported here provide further evidence of the
   functional independence of approach and avoidance responding.
   Furthermore, the differential pattern of correlations observed provide
   further evidence that the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task affected a
   behavior-behavior relation, which may be directly relevant to the
   concept of defusion in the ACT literature. In addition, the differential
   arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model
   offers an alternative explanation for the results reported.},

Abstract = {First-degree family history is an established risk factor for
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of late-onset
   AD risk loci with cognitive functioning among 315 offspring of AD
   patients. Participants were cognitively normal Jewish individuals, aged
   40-65 years, from the Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP)
   study. Twenty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these
   loci and the APOE E4 allele were included in the final analyses, and a
   polygenic risk score was also calculated. Using linear regression
   (assuming an additive genetic model), we found a significant association
   only for SNP rs9473117, located near the CD2-associated protein (CD2AP)
   gene, with global cognition. Controlling for demographic variables (age,
   sex, years of education, and ancestry), the late onset AD risk allele C
   was associated with lower global cognitive functioning (p = 0.0005), and
   withstood correction for multiple testing. After adjusting for
   additional characteristics (APOE E4 status and then also for
   cardiovascular factors), the results remained essentially unchanged (p =
   0.0003 and p = 0.0005, respectively). In secondary analyses examining
   specific cognitive domains, rs9473117 was similarly associated with
   episodic memory (p = 0.005), language (p = 0.009), and working memory/
   attention (p = 0.018) but not with executive functions (p = 0.27).
   Again, the results were similar after adjusting for APOE E4 status and
   cardiovascular factors. The polygenic risk score was not associated with
   global cognitive functioning or with any of the 4 domains. In
   conclusion, our findings suggest a contribution of the CD2AP locus to
   cognitive functioning in middle-aged individuals with a parental history
   of AD. Further validations, including in longitudinal studies, are
   required. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
