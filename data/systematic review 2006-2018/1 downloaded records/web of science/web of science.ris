AB  - Experiment 1 aimed to establish “fearful” and “pleasant” functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar' Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.

T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB  - The effects of rules on human behaviour have long been identified as important in the psychological literature. The increasing importance of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous research has suggested may differentially impact persistent rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development: mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly, however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results across both experiments and their implications for future research are discussed.

T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
AB  - Research on self-determination theory has typically relied on explicit measures when examining the concept of competence need satisfaction. As a result, we know relatively little about competence need satisfaction that arises under conditions of automaticity. Across four studies, we developed and validated implicit measures of competence need satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together, these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence. Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low reliability of the IRAP.

T2  - BEHAVIOR ANALYST
AB  - This article describes how the study of derived stimulus relations has provided the basis for a behavior-analytic approach to the study of human language and cognition in purely functional-analytic terms, with a focus on basic rather than applied research. The article begins with a brief history of the early behavior-analytic approach to human language and cognition, focusing on Skinner's (1957) text Verbal Behavior, his subsequent introduction of the concept of instructional control (Skinner, 1966), and Sidman's (1994) seminal research on stimulus equivalence relations. The article then considers how the concept of derived stimulus relations, as conceptualized within relational frame theory (Hayes et al., 2001), allowed researchers to refine and extend the functional approach to language and cognition in multiple ways. Finally, the article considers some recent conceptual and empirical developments that highlight how the concept of derived stimulus relations continues to play a key role in the behavior-analytic study of human language and cognition, particularly implicit cognition. In general, the article aims to provide a particular perspective on how the study of derived stimulus relations has facilitated and enhanced the behavior analysis of human language and cognition, particularly over the past 25-30 years.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Under the rubric of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), researchers have investigated the role of deictic relational responding in the analysis of self in relation to others, place, and time, primarily through the use of an extended developmental protocol (Barnes-Holmes, 2001). In a move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological Record, 66, 243-252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to self was involved, only responding to others. The results from Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the read-aloud procedure.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Stigmatizing attitudes about individuals with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) are known to contribute to the individual's psychological problems and response to treatment. Providers of SUD treatment services have been shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures. However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD treatment and therapist training.

AU  - Pennie, Brian
AU  - Kelly, Michelle E.
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The research investigated the contextual effects of mood on implicit measures of `wanting more' as a proxy of materialism and investigated the basic verbal processes underpinning this behaviour. Sixty university students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n= 19) mood induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS), materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP, shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad) compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were interpreted as an implicit bias towards `wanting more'. Compared to the neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition demonstrated an increased bias towards `wanting less' (p = .028). Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with an implicit bias towards `wanting more' (r(s)'s ranging from - .455 to -. 565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards wanting less (r(s) = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of `wanting more' as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) perspective.

Participants first completed an explicit measure of their attitudes toward cyberbullying, followed by an implicit measure in the form of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results revealed that participants displayed a combination of anti- and pro-cyberbullying attitudes. There was no statistically significant correlation between participants' implicit and explicit attitudes toward cyberbullying. The current findings may have important implications for our understanding of adolescents' attitudes toward cyberbullying and the development of relevant educational programs.

AU  - Finn, Martin

AU  - McEnteggart, Ciara
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc explanation provided in a previously published article, the first experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved in producing IRAP effects-the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model-which is presented in the General Discussion.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used to assess the probability of arbitrarily applicable relational responding or as an indirect measure of implicit attitudes. To date, IRAP effects have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semi-parametric measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement, & Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models, in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.

T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
AB  - It has been proposed that a crucial link between cognitive (i.e., self-schemas) and biological vulnerability is prefrontal control. This is because decreased control leads to impaired ability to inhibit ruminative thinking after the activation of negative self-schemas. However, current evidence is mainly correlational. In the current experimental study we tested whether the effect of neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on self-esteem is mediated by momentary ruminative self-referential thinking (MRST) after the induction of negative self-schemas by criticism. We used a single, sham-controlled crossover session of anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC (cathode over the right supraorbital region) in healthy female individuals. After receiving tDCS/sham stimulation, we measured MRST and exposed the participants to critical audio scripts, followed by another MRST measurement. Subsequently, all participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures to implicitly measure actual and ideal self-esteem. Our behavioral data indicated a significant decrease in MRST after real but not sham tDCS. Moreover, although there was no immediate effect of tDCS on implicit self-esteem, an indirect effect was found through double mediation, with the difference in MRST from baseline to after stimulation and from baseline to after criticism as our two mediators. The larger the decrease of criticism induced MRST after real tDCS, the higher the level of actual self-esteem. Our results show that tDCS can influence cognitive processes such as rumination, and subsequently self-esteem, but only after the activation of negative self-schemas. Rumination and negative self-esteem characterize different forms of psychopathology, and these data expand our knowledge of the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling these self-referential processes, and the mechanisms of action of tDCS.

T2  - NEUROPEPTIDES
AB  - LVV-hemorphin-7 (LW-h7) is bioactive peptide resulting from degradation of hemoglobin beta-globin chain. LVV-7 is a specific agonist of angiotensin IV receptor. This receptor belongs to the class of insulin-regulated aminopeptidases (IMP), which displays oxytocinase activity. Herein, our aims were to assess whether: i) LVV-h7 modifies centrally organized behavior and cardiovascular responses to stress and ii) mechanisms underlying LVV-h7 effects involve activation of oxytocin (OT) receptors, probably as result of reduction of IRAP proteolytic activity upon OT. Adult male Wistar rats (270-370 g) received (i.p.) injections of LVV-h7 (153 nmol/kg), or vehicle (0.1 ml). Different protocols were used: i) open field (OP) test for locomotor/exploratory activities; ii) Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) for anxiety-like behavior; iii) forced swimming test (FST) test for depression-like behavior and iv) air jet for cardiovascular reactivity to acute stress exposure. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) and imipramine (15 mg/kg) were used as positive control for EPM and FST, respectively. The antagonist of OT receptors (OTr), atosiban (1 and 0,1 mg/kg), was used to determine the involvement of oxytocinergic paths. We found that LVV-h7: i) increased the number of entries and the time spent in open arms of the maze, an indicative of anxiolysis; ii) provoked antidepressant effect in the FS test; and iii) increased the exploration and locomotion; iv) did not change the cardiovascular reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to acute stress. Also, increases in locomotion and the antidepressant effects evoked by LVV-h7 were reverted by OTr antagonist. We conclude that LVV-h7 modulates behavior, displays antidepressant and anxiolytic effects that are mediated in part by oxytocin receptors.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The present study examined participants' implicit and explicit attitudes toward mainstream and BDSM (bondage and discipline/dominance and submission/sadism and masochism) sexual terms using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and several questionnaires and investigated the relationship between scores on these measures and participant behavior toward a BDSM-labeled and a non-BDSM-labeled confederate during an interviewing task. Twenty-one participants, who were either graduate psychology students or practicing clinicians, completed the study. Results were consistent with previous research (Stockwell, Walker, & Eshleman, The Psychological Record, 60(2), 307-324, 2010) in that responses on both the IRAP and Visual Analogue Scales showed an acceptance of mainstream sexual terms and unfavorable responding to BDSM terms; in contrast, Likert-scale questionnaire responses generally reflected favorable attitudes toward people who practice BDSM. IRAP scores were positively correlated with differences in smiling across the two interview conditions; that is, participants with anti-BDSM responding on the IRAP smiled significantly less while interviewing the BDSM-labeled confederate than when they interviewed the non-BDSM confederate. No other differences in interviewing behavior were observed or correlated with IRAP responding, suggesting that implicit attitudes may not be a reliable predictor of participant behavior during interviews of individuals labeled as practicing BDSM.

AB  - The current research aimed to examine the implicit biases of smokers and nonsmokers to others who did or did not smoke. Study 1 presented adult smokers and nonsmokers with an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that assessed bias toward or against smokers and nonsmokers. Study 2 replicated this with adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Both studies also presented self-report measures. Both adult and adolescent smokers produced IRAP effects that indicated prosmoker biases; nonsmokers' biases were relatively neutral. Trends in the data from Studies 1 and 2 led to a post hoc analysis of the nonsmoker data to investigate the potential impact of parental smoking status on nonsmokers' biases. Both the IRAP and self-report measures data suggested that parental smoking status increased positivity in attitudes toward smokers among nonsmokers. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that the IRAP data in Study 1, but not Study 2, predicted smoking status above and beyond the self-report measures. The post hoc analyses showed a similar trend. The consistency of the findings with the only existing IRAP study of attitudes toward smokers, as well as with the broader literature, supports the view that response biases toward smokers may not change fundamentally from adolescence to adulthood, and that parental smoking status may having a moderating influence on these biases.

AB  - The current study examined racial bias among White individuals residing in Ireland using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In addition, neural activity, measured with electroencephalograms (EEGs), was recorded while participants completed the IRAP. On some blocks of trials, participants were required to respond quickly and accurately in a pro-White and anti-Black manner, whereas on other blocks they were required to respond in the opposite manner (anti-White or pro-Black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias, and event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from the EEG signals, provided a simultaneous measure of brain activity during these responses. Results revealed anti-Black and pro-White biased responding on the IRAP in terms of differential response latencies. In addition, greater positivity in the ERP signals located in the frontal sites was recorded when participants responded in a pro-Black or anti-White pattern relative to a pro-White or anti-Black pattern. These results are broadly consistent with those of previous literature in the area and suggest that the IRAP is a potentially useful methodology for research in the field of affective neuroscience.

AB  - Background and objectives: The relationship between self-esteem and paranoia may be influenced by social stress. This study aimed to replicate previous research on the impact ofsocial exclusion on paranoia and self-esteem in a non-clinical sample and to extend this work by examining the effect of exclusion on self-esteem at the `implicit' level. Methods: Non-clinical participants (N = 85) were randomly allocated to the Inclusion or Exclusion condition of a virtual ball-toss game ('Cyberball'). They completed self-reportmeasures of state paranoia and self-esteem, and two implicit measures of self-esteem - theImplicit Association Task (IAT) and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) -prior to and after exposure to Cyberball. Results: Social exclusion increased state paranoia. This effect was moderated by distress associated with trait paranoia. Exclusion was also associated with decreased self-reported self-esteem, as well as reduced implicit self-esteem on the IAT. Changes in self-reported self-esteem were associated with state paranoia at post-Cyberball. The IRAP indicated that reductions in implicit self-esteem may be due to increases in `Me-Negative' and `Others-Positive' biases (rather than reductions in `Me-Positive' bias). Limitations: The current study involved a non-clinical sample and so findings cannot be generalized to clinical paranoia. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous evidence that paranoia is associated with negative self-evaluations, whereas positive self-evaluations can persist in paranoia. They also provide support for the suggestion that investigations of self-esteem in paranoia should extend beyond global self-esteem and might benefit from a distinction between positive and negative components.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The study investigated how conflicting stimulus-response mappings influenced affordance processing given a manipulation of the functional relations. Participants performed a task involving consistent-inconsistent stimulus-response mappings: Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). They were instructed to confirm or to deny a relation between words and tool-objects (consistent blocks) or to provide non-conventional responses (inconsistent blocks). The relations between stimuli could functionally match (e.g., Kitchen- Spatula) or not (e.g., Kitchen- Hammer), as well as the spatial relations (e.g., a match or a mismatch between participants' hand response and the tool-object orientation). The results showed faster reaction times (RTs) when functional relations between stimuli matched both in consistent and inconsistent blocks. Differences in RTs and accuracy between consistent and inconsistent blocks were only found when the functional relation between stimuli matched. No modulation of the performance was observed for mismatching functional relations and spatial relations between blocks. These results support the hypothesis that the responsiveness to affordances is strongly modulated by matching functional relations, despite the impact of conflicting stimulus-response mappings.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The article presents the beginnings of a conceptual framework for analyzing the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARRing). The framework focuses on the dimensions and levels of AARRing that have been the focus of empirical and conceptual analyses in the literature on relational frame theory over the past 30 years. The name of the framework is abbreviated the MDML, and the conceptual and empirical context from which it emerged is presented. The framework currently consists of four dimensions, (i) coherence, (ii) complexity, (iii) derivation, and (iv) flexibility; and five levels of relational development, (i) mutual entailing, (ii) relational framing, (iii) relational networking, (iv) relating relations, and (v) relating relational networks. Within the MDML, each of the dimensions intersects with each of the levels, yielding 20 potential units of behavioral analysis, defined as functional-analytic abstractive relational quanta (abbreviated as FAARQs). Some of the conceptual and empirical implications of the MDML are considered, focusing in particular on how it highlights the dynamic properties of AARRing. Specific examples of how the MDML is (and may) impact upon research in relational frame theory are also presented.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP, Barnes-Holmes et al. in Psychol Rec 60:527-542, 2010) was utilized as a relatively new tool to measure implicit weight bias in first- and third-year medical students. To date, only two studies (Miller et al. in Acad Med 88:978-982, 2013; Phelan et al. in Med Educ 49:983-992, 2015) have investigated implicit weight bias with medical students and both have found pro-thin/anti-fat implicit attitudes, on average, using the Implicit Association Test (IAT, Greenwald and Banaji in Psychol Rev 102:4-27, 1995) as the assessment tool. The IRAP, however, allows for a deeper analysis of implicit attitudes with respect to both thin and fat in isolation, and it was found that medical students are, on average, actually both pro-thin and pro-fat, and on average are more pro-thin than pro-fat, as opposed to anti-fat. Additionally, it was found that medical students' implicit weight bias against fat/obese individuals improved over the first 2 years of medical training, and this improvement was specifically driven by improved implicit attitudes toward overweight and obese, while implicit attitudes toward thin remained constant over that time. The implications of more sensitive implicit bias assessment and specific changes in bias over time are discussed within the context of medical education curriculum development.

AB  - The present study examined levels of racial bias among black and white individuals residing in Ireland using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and a range of questionnaire measures. The IRAP required participants to respond quickly and accurately on a computer-based task. On some blocks of trials participants were required to respond in a pro-white and anti-black manner, whereas on other blocks responding in the opposite direction was required (anti-white/pro-black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias. Performance on the IRAP (i) revealed in-group/out-group bias for the white but not the black participants; (ii) substantively increased the predictive validity of a range of questionnaire-based measures; and (iii) provided the best prediction of racial group. The results support the utility of the IRAP as a measure of racial bias, and indicate that this bias differed between black and white Irish residents.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The current study examined the impact of a brief verbal rehearsal task on performance on two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs), actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a behavioral approach task; BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT. Participants first completed the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) followed by one of two verbal rehearsal tasks, one of which focused on fear acceptance and the other on fear reduction as ways of coping with fear. All participants then completed two IRAPs similar to those employed by Leech, Barnes- Holmes, and Madden (The Psychological Record, 66(3), doi: 10.1007/s40732-016-0176-1, 2016). Finally, participants completed the BAT using a live common house spider. Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. No significant differences between the two verbal-rehearsal conditions emerged on the self-report measures, the IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated in the reduce-fear condition. When considered in the context of the results previously reported by Leech et al., the differential pattern of correlations observed in the current study suggest that the verbal rehearsal task impacted upon a behavior-behavior relation that may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the acceptance and commitment therapy literature.

AB  - The vasopressin- and oxytocin-degrading enzyme insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is expressed in various organs including the brain. However, knowledge about its presence in human hypothalamus is fragmentary. Functionally, for a number of reasons (genetic linkage, hydrolysis of oxytocin and vasopressin, its role as angiotensin IV receptor in learning and memory and others) IRAP might play a role in schizophrenia. We studied the regional and cellular localization of IRAP in normal human brain with special emphasis on the hypothalamus and determined numerical densities of IRAP-expressing cells in the paraventricular, supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei in schizophrenia patients and controls. By using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, IRAP was immunolocalized in postmortem human brains. Cell countings were performed to estimate numbers and numerical densities of IRAP immunoreactive hypothalamic neurons in schizophrenia patients and control cases. Shape, size and regional distribution of IRAP-expressing cells, as well the lack of co-localization with the glia marker glutamine synthetase, show that IRAP is expressed in neurons. IRAP immunoreactive cells were observed in the hippocampal formation, cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdala and, abundantly, hypothalamus. Double labeling experiments (IRAP and oxytocin/neurophysin 1, IRAP with vasopressin/neurophysin 2) revealed that IRAP is present in oxytocinergic and in vasopressinergic neurons. In schizophrenia patients, the numerical density of IRAP-expressing neurons in the paraventricular and the suprachiasmatic nuclei is significantly reduced, which might be associated with the reduction in neurophysin-containing neurons in these nuclei in schizophrenia. The pathophysiological role of lowered hypothalamic IRAP expression in schizophrenia remains to be established.

AB  - This study sought to examine the relationship of implicit emotional judgments with experiential avoidance (EA) and social anxiety. A sample of 61 college students completed the Emotional Judgment - Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (EJ-IRAP) as well as a public speaking challenge. Implicit judgments were related to greater self-reported EA, anxiety sensitivity, emotional judgments and social anxiety as well as lower performance ratings and willingness in the public speaking challenge. Effects differed by trial type with “Anxiety is bad” biases related to greater EA/anxiety, while “calm is bad” biases related to lower EA/anxiety (”Good” biases were generally unrelated to outcomes). Implicit emotional judgments moderated the relationship of heart rate during the speech with speech time and willingness, such that increases in heart rate were only related to lower speech time and willingness among those high in implicit judgments. Implicit judgments predicted social anxiety above and beyond self-report EA measures. Implicit emotional judgments appear to have a functional role in EA and anxiety that warrants further research.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Despite their application in virtually every area of psychological science, indirect procedures have rarely been used to study how Catholic and Protestants automatically respond to one another in Northern Ireland. What little evidence that does exist suggests that automatic ingroup favoritism occurs alongside outgroup derogation. That is, Catholics and Protestants automatically evaluate ingroup members more positively than outgroup members, and also evaluate outgroup members more negatively than ingroup members. The current study addresses a methodological limitation in this early work and provides the first (non-relativistic) assessment of intergroup relational responding in a post-conflict setting using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Contrary to earlier findings, participants displayed evidence of ingroup favoritism in the absence of outgroup derogation.

AB  - The social construction of gender-as-binary plays an important role within many contemporary theories of gender inequality. However, to date, the field of psychology has struggled with the operationalization and assessment of binarist ideologies. The current article proposes a technical framework for the analysis of the gender binary and assesses the suitability of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of binarist gender beliefs. Forty-seven undergraduate students (26 female; M-age = 23.84) completed two IRAPs assessing the coordination of certain traits exclusively with women and others exclusively with men. Effects found on the IRAP were in the expected direction (i.e., relating men but not women with certain traits and women but not men with other traits). In addition, the traits ascribed to men within the IRAP were evaluated as more hirable by a large majority of participants (83%) on an explicit preference task. The results therefore support the arguments that, first, gender traits do seem to be framed oppositionally in language and, second, this binary may underpin existing gender hierarchies in certain contexts.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to validate a standardized procedure for measuring attitudes towards suicide in university students. As the concurrent validation criteria for the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to suicide (IRAP-HS), the Positive and Negative Suicidal Ideas Inventory (PANSI) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale were administered to a sample of 102 students of the University of Narino. Although the results found lack of a strong response to consider the clinical applicability of the IRAP-HS in the short term, the behavior of the DIRAP scores (obtained through a process that seeks to counteract the effects of participant variability related to factors such as age, motor skills and intelligence) in the different comparison groups does not definitively allow dismissing that the response latency to the trials is being affected by the degree of consistency between the verbal network of the participants and the relationships specified in the contingency arrangements of the procedure. Finally, some implications of the results for the applicability of IRAP-HS in clinical practice are analyzed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Women remain under-represented in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM), constituting only 28% of science researchers worldwide. Research has identified implicit gender-bias as a major barrier to women's progression in these fields. Previous research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) suggests that individuals studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for the development of interventions. If this relational response can become more normative it may influence attitudes and behavior towards women in STEM.

AB  - Central infusion of Insulin-Regulated Aminopeptidase (IRAP) inhibitors improves memory in both normal rodents and in models of memory deficit. However, in contrast, the global IRAP knockout mice (KO) demonstrate age-accelerated spatial memory deficits and no improvements in performance in any memory tasks. Potentially, the observed memory deficit could be due to the absence of IRAP in the developing brain. We therefore generated a postnatal forebrain neuron-specific IRAP knockout mouse line (CamKIIalphaCre; IRAPIox/Iox). Unexpectedly, we demonstrated that postnatal deletion of IRAP in the brain results in significant deficits in both spatial reference and object recognition memory at three months of age, although spatial working memory remained intact. These results indicate a significant role for IRAP in postnatal brain development and normal function of the hippocampus in adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The current research used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a preliminary step toward bringing a broad, functional approach to understanding psychosis, by focusing on the specific phenomenon of auditory hallucinations of voices and sounds (often referred to as hearing voices). On this path, we created a taxonomy of some critical features of voice hearing based on the existing literature (i.e., perceived normality of voices, appraisals of self and other people hearing voices, and fear of voices) as a focus of our experimental manipulations. It was our hope that our findings would add to the broad literature that has used explicit measures to study these phenomena, and that the use of an `implicit' measure might assist toward a functional analytic understanding. Three pilot studies were conducted to assess the relations within which hearing voices participates in non-clinical voice hearers (i.e., individuals who hear voices but have no clinical diagnosis or distress) and compared to non-voice hearing control participants. The IRAP effects demonstrated both positive and negative relational responses across the three studies, and these effects varied according to explicit levels of delusional ideation. Furthermore, these IRAP effects also predicted explicit aspects of voice hearing and well-being. The current set of pilot studies demonstrate the utility and precision of the IRAP in this domain, and we propose that this type of experimental analysis may hold potential for future bottom-up functional analyses of voice hearing.

The key purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility of altering the way in which stimuli are presented within the IRAP, so as to potentially employ more complex natural language-like statements in future research. In the Typical IRAP employed here, labels and targets were presented as separate words, while in the Natural Language IRAP they were combined to form a single statement. The results demonstrated no substantive differences in the effects recorded on both types of IRAP, thus supporting the future use of a Natural Language version.

AB  - The zinc metallopeptidase insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is highly expressed in the hippocampus and other brain regions associated with cognitive function, has been identified as a high-affinity binding site of the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV). This hexapeptide is thought to facilitate learning and memory by binding to the catalytic site of IRAP to inhibit its enzymatic activity. In support of this hypothesis, low molecular weight, nonpeptide specific inhibitors of TRAP have been shown to enhance memory in rodent models. Recently, it was demonstrated that linear and macrocyclic Ang IV-derived peptides can alter the shape and increase the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal cultures, properties associated with enhanced cognitive performance. After screening a library of 10 500 drug like substances for their ability to inhibit IRAP, we identified a series of low molecular weight aryl sulfonamides, which exhibit no structural similarity to Ang IV, as moderately potent IRAP inhibitors:A structural and biological characterization of three of these aryl sulfonamides was performed. Their binding modes to human IRAP were explored by docking calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations and binding affinity estimations using the linear interaction energy method. Two alternative binding modes emerged from this analysis, both of which correctly rank the ligands according to their experimental binding affinities for this series of compounds. Finally, we show that two of these drug-like IRAP inhibitors can alter dendritic spine morphology and increase spine density in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Objective: The current study examined the impact of varying pictorial cues and testing contexts on implicit alcohol-related expectancies. Method: Seventy-six participants were assigned randomly to complete an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in either a pub or lecture context. The TRAP exposed participants to pictorial cues that depicted an alcoholic beverage in the foreground of a pub (alcohol-congruent stimuli) or university lecture theater (alcohol incongruent stimuli), and participants were required to match both positive and negative alcohol-related outcome expectancies to these stimuli. Corresponding to a 4 x 2 design, TRAP trial types were included in the analysis as repeated-measure variables, whereas testing environment was input as a between-participants variable. Results: Participants more readily endorsed that drinking alcohol was related to positive expectancies when responding to alcohol-congruent stimuli, and this was strengthened when participants completed the task in a pub. Moreover, they more readily confirmed that alcohol was related to negative expectancies when responding to alcohol-incongruent stimuli. Conclusions: These findings suggest that alcohol-related cues and environmental contexts may be a significant driver of positive alcohol-related cognitions, which may have implications for the design of interventions. They emphasize further the importance of examining implicit cognitions in ecologically valid testing contexts.

AB  - The current study examined the use of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of spider fear, approach, and avoidance. Participants were drawn from a normative sample of university undergraduates. Experiment 1employed two IRAPs, one targeting spider fear, the other targeting spider approach/avoidance. The Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) and a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) using a spider moult were also employed. Negative response biases for spider fear and avoidance, but not for approach, were recorded. The bias for fear was significantly stronger than for avoidance and approach. Both IRAP's failed to provide evidence for the predicative validity of the IRAP in terms of the BAT. Experiment 2 was a partial replication of Experiment 1 but using a live house spider instead of a moult for the BAT. A similar pattern of results was obtained across the two IRAPs, but one specific trial-type (SpiderApproach) predicted approach responses on the BAT. The research, thus, replicated a previously published study by Nicholson and Barnes-Holmes (2012), thus supporting the predictive validity of the IRAP but at a level of precision not provided in the earlier study. Implications for applied research are considered.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The current study examined the role of relational contextual cues (Crels) versus relational coherence indicators (RCIs) as response options in the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). Fifty-two university undergraduate participants successfully completed two consecutive IRAPs. Both IRAPs were similar except for the response options employed. The Crels similar and different served as response options for one IRAP with the RCIs true and false as response options for the other. The order in which the two different IRAPs were completed was counterbalanced across participants. Although the two types of response options yielded similar effects for the participants' first exposures to the IRAPs, differences emerged during the second exposures. In addition, one of the four trial types from the IRAP appeared to be particularly sensitive to the Crel-RCI manipulation and the order in which the two types of IRAP blocks were presented (consistent-first versus inconsistent-first with natural verbal relations). The findings highlight the complex behavioral dynamics that may be involved in IRAP performances and suggest that even seemingly trivial components of the procedure require systematic analysis.

AB  - Research using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) suggests that a positive bias toward thinness, rather than a negative bias toward fatness, might underlie implicitly assessed evaluative responding regarding body image. Because these results contrast with reports of widespread anti-fat attitudes, we aimed to clarify the nature of implicitly assessed evaluative body image responding by using stimuli more central to body image concerns. Seventy-five undergraduates (65.8 % female) completed two IRAPs to examine three aims: (1) create IRAPs sensitive to histories of self-oriented anti-fat responding by using attractiveness-,fear-, and disgust-based stimulus relations; (2) evaluate responses to the different types of stimulus relations on the IRAPs separately and compare them to each other; and (3) examine correlations among IRAP responding and self-report measures of disgust, fear of fatness, and eating pathology. Results showed that participants demonstrated a self-thin-attractive relational bias. Unexpectedly, respondents also showed a self-fat-attractive relational bias and did not display self-fat-disgusting or self-fat-fear responding. IRAP effects for self-thin-attractive stimulus relations were larger than those for self-fat-attractive stimulus relations, suggesting the proself bias on these two trial types was larger when relating to oneself as being thin than when relating to oneself as being overweight. Correlations with self-report measures were nonsignificant. Results are discussed in the context of gaining a better understanding of implicit evaluative body image responding and contextual variables that influence IRAP responding.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Experiential avoidance (EA) is a generalized risk factor for psychopathology and is defined as an unwillingness to remain in contact with private events. A number of behavioral tasks have demonstrated potential in assessing EA, including a limited number of studies using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). IRAP studies of EA to date have involved relatively small samples, limited consideration of dependent variables, and/or stimulus configurations that addressed a conceptually narrow aspect of EA. The current study describes the initial piloting of an IRAP designed to assess implicit repertoires regarding EA and acceptance in response to anxiety-relevant and positive emotional words. A variety of conceptually relevant self-report measures were administered along with the EA IRAP to a sample of college undergraduates. Dependent variables included average latencies for each block type as well as D-scores for each trial type of the IRAP. Evidence for convergent validity was revealed by correlations between the IRAP block-type latencies and a self-report measure of defusion, while unexpected divergent relations were obtained between self-reports and IRAP D-scores. Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated. We discuss alternative approaches to stimulus selection (including response options), increased efforts to reduce attrition, and utilization of clinical samples.

AB  - Across four studies, we demonstrate that effects obtained from the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, like those obtained from other indirect procedures, are not impervious to strategic manipulation. In experiment 1, we found that merely informing participants to “fake” their performance without providing a concrete strategy to do so did not eliminate, reverse, or in any way alter the obtained outcomes. However, when those same instructions orientated attention toward the core parameters of the task, participants spontaneously derived a strategy that allowed them to eliminate their effects (experiment 2). When the participants were provided with a viable response strategy, they successfully reversed the direction of their overall Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure effect (experiment 3). By refining the nature of those instructions, we managed to target and alter individual trial-type effects in isolation with some success (experiment 4).

AB  - The current study investigated potential changes in implicit negativity of hearing voices in a non-voice hearing student population (N=28) subjected to a hearing voices simulation using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). On the Baseline IRAP, participants were required to pair voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative statements on alternating trial blocks. Participants were subsequently exposed to a simulation procedure and a Post-simulation IRAP. At baseline and post-simulation, hearing voices was implicitly evaluated as both positive and fearful, however positivity toward voices reduced and negativity increased after the simulation. Interestingly, implicit changes also appeared to be influenced by high delusional ideation. (C) 2016 Association for Contextual Behavioral Science. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study aimed to design a preliminary implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to measure the increased complexity and the flexibility in perspective taking (PT). Undergraduate students (N = 35) from a Spanish university completed a PT scale and a PT task (deictic relational task; DRT) that involved trials with different complexity (reversed and double reversed). Then, participants were asked to complete an IRAP to assess the level of complexity and flexibility involved in perspective-taking framing. Results showed that the IRAP captured the differences, on the one hand, in relational complexity when the participants were asked to respond saying Yes or No to their own perspective and, on the other hand, in relational flexibility when they were asked to change their own perspective. In addition, the IRAP effect correlated with high deictic ability as measured by the DRT (mainly in double-reversed trials). These findings suggest that the IRAP as designed in the present study seems to be a good indicator of complexity and flexibility in PT.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is frequently employed over other measures of so-called implicit attitudes because it produces 4 independent and “nonrelative” bias scores, thereby providing greater clarity around what drives an effect. Indeed, studies have sometimes emphasized the procedural separation of the four trial types by choosing to report only the results of a single, theoretically meaningful trial type. However, no research to date has examined the degree to which performance on a given trial type is impacted upon by other stimulus categories employed within the task. The current study examined the extent to which response biases toward “women” are influenced by two different contrast categories: “men” versus “inanimate objects.” Results indicated that greater dehumanization of women was observed in the context of the latter relative to the former category. The findings highlight that the IRAP may be described as a nonrelative, but not acontextual, measure of brief and immediate relational responses.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is increasingly used in applied and clinical settings, and yet many of the procedural variables of the measure have not been subjected to a systematic analysis. One such variable is the type of rules that are employed when instructing the IRAP and the effect this might have on participants' performances. In the current article, three experiments were used to assess the impact of three different types of rules or instructions on IRAP performance. The instructions varied in the degree to which they specified parts of the relational network being assessed by the IRAP. The findings showed that the type of rule presented to participants during an IRAP can have a dramatic effect on the strength and direction of the trial-type effects that are produced by the measure. Furthermore, the type of instructions employed appear to interact with the order in which the IRAP blocks are presented (history-consistent versus history-inconsistent). The findings indicate that the behavioural dynamics that occur when participants complete an IRAP require extensive and systematic experimental and conceptual analyses, and this work will likely have an important bearing on research seeking to investigate the predictive validity of the IRAP in applied research settings.

AU  - Hussey, I.
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, D.
AU  - Booth, R.
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and objectives: Suicidal behaviour has proved to be difficult to predict, due in part to the particular limitations of introspection within suicidality. In an effort to overcome this, recent research has demonstrated the utility of indirect measures of “implicit” attitudes within the study of suicidality. However, research to date has focused predominantly on implicit self-evaluations and self-death associations. No work has examined implicit evaluations of death, despite the theoretical importance of such evaluations; “fearlessness of death” is central to both the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicide. Methods: Twenty-three psychiatric patients with current suicidal ideation and twenty-five normative university students completed two versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that targeted evaluations of death. One task specified personal death (i.e., was self-focused) and the other targeted death in the abstract. Results: Self-focused evaluations of death reliably distinguished between the two groups, correctly classifying 74% of cases, but evaluations of death in the abstract did not. The suicidal group produced specific biases indicating a rejection of the negativity of death. Results are consistent with the definition of suicidality as involving a self-focused wish to die.. Limitations: For ethical reason, suicidal behaviours were not assessed in the normative group. Groups were therefore not mutually exclusive. This may have decreased the specificity of the IRAP. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is associated with an implicit “fearlessness of death”. The utility of implicit death-evaluations should therefore be considered alongside self-evaluations and self-death associations in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been argued that obese individuals evaluate high caloric, palatable foods more positively than their normal weight peers, and that this positivity bias causes them to consume such foods, even when healthy alternatives are available. Yet when self-reported and automatic food preferences are assessed no such evaluative biases tend to emerge. We argue that situational (food deprivation) and methodological factors may explain why implicit measures often fail to discriminate between the food-evaluations of these two groups. Across three studies we manipulated the food deprivation state of clinically obese and normal-weight participants and then exposed them to an indirect procedure (IRAP) and self-report questionnaires. We found that automatic food-related cognition was moderated by a person's weight status and food deprivation state. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic and predictive value of implicit measures may be increased when (a) situational moderators are taken into consideration and (b) we pay greater attention to the different ways in which people automatically relate rather than simply categorize food stimuli.

AU  - Timmins, Liam

T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AB  - Snowden, Wichter, and Gray (2008) demonstrated that an Implicit Association Test and a Priming Task both predicted the sexual orientation of gynephilic and androphilic men in terms of their attraction biases towards pictures of nude males and females. For both measures, relative bias scores were obtained, with no information on the separate response biases to each target gender. The present study sought to extend this research by assessing both relative and individual implicit biases using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). An explicit measure screened for men with androphilic (n = 16) or gynephilic (n = 16) orientations on the dimensions of “sexual attraction,” “sexual behavior,” “sexual fantasies,” “hetero/gay lifestyle,” and “self identification.” The IRAP involved responding “True” or “False” to pictures of nude males and females as either attractive or unattractive. Participants were required to respond in a manner consistent with their reported sexual orientation for half of the IRAP's test blocks and inconsistent for the other half. Response latencies were recorded and analyzed. The IRAP revealed a non-orthogonal pattern of biases across the two groups and had an excellent ability to predict sexual orientation with areas under the curves of 1.0 for the relative bias score and .94 and .95 for the bias scores for the male and female pictures, respectively. Correlations between the IRAP and explicit measures of sexual orientation were consistently high. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially valuable tool in the study of sexual preferences.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Although multiple studies have demonstrated that the Implicit Association Test (IAT) can be successfully faked, a single study using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP; McKenna, Barnes-Holmes, Barnes-Holmes, & Stewart, International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy, 7(2): 253-268, 2007) concluded that this behavior-analytic alternative to implicit measures may be relatively immune to faking. The current study examined the fakability of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an opportunity to examine split-half and test-retest reliability, an underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test-retest correlations; the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a significant test-retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but also the reliability of the measure. Future research might focus on methods of detecting and/or preventing faking of the procedure.

AB  - The current study aimed to test the effect of behavior therapy training on the assessment of self-forgiveness, focusing on the feelings or outcomes that may be associated with failing and succeeding in everyday life, using 2 Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) that had been developed across a series of previously published studies. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which responding on the IRAP correlated with standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Forty undergraduate and postgraduate students completed the study (20 individuals who were teaching on, attending, or who had attended a course in clinical behavior analysis and 20 students from different fields). The two groups (behavior therapists and nontherapists) completed the 2 IRAPs and the explicit measures. Overall, only 1 of the 2 IRAPs, the one that targeted feelings rather than outcomes, produced clear and significant differences between the behavior therapist and nontherapist groups. This result indicated that the diverging performances were specific to the stimuli that were presented in the IRAP rather than reflecting a generic between-group difference produced by the measure itself. Furthermore, both IRAPs predicted levels of self-reported psychopathology and self-compassion. A number of potential reasons why this pattern of results emerged using the 2 IRAPs and explicit measures with these 2 groups of participants are considered.

AU  - O'Shea, Brian

AU  - Brown, Gordon D. A.
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
AB  - How can implicit attitudes best be measured? The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), unlike the Implicit Association Test (IAT), claims to measure absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes. In the IRAP, participants make congruent (Fat Person-Active: false; Fat Person-Unhealthy: true) or incongruent (Fat Person-Active: true; Fat Person-Unhealthy: false) responses in different blocks of trials. IRAP experiments have reported positive or neutral implicit attitudes (e.g., neutral attitudes toward fat people) in cases in which negative attitudes are normally found on explicit or other implicit measures. It was hypothesized that these results might reflect a positive framing bias (PFB) that occurs when participants complete the IRAP. Implicit attitudes toward categories with varying prior associations (nonwords, social systems, flowers and insects, thin and fat people) were measured. Three conditions (standard, positive framing, and negative framing) were used to measure whether framing influenced estimates of implicit attitudes. It was found that IRAP scores were influenced by how the task was framed to the participants, that the framing effect was modulated by the strength of prior stimulus associations, and that a default PFB led to an overestimation of positive implicit attitudes when measured by the IRAP. Overall, the findings question the validity of the IRAP as a tool for the measurement of absolute implicit attitudes. A new tool (Simple Implicit Procedure: SIP) for measuring absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes is proposed.

Using a relative heart rate measure, the first experiment compared individually selected phrases focused on the positive consequences of exercise to general topographic advice about how to exercise using an alternating treatments design, and found that participants exercised harder in the presence of the reinforcer-focused phrases. Experiment 2 tested a similar comparison using phrases focused on consequences that were shown to be neutral or negative by the IRAP, and found no consistent effect on responding. These results support a key prediction from previous research in Relational Frame Theory, namely that reinforcer focused statements can function as motivative augmentals, and they suggest that such motivative effects can impact behaviours of applied importance such as exercise.

AB  - This study aimed to test the effect of positive and negative priming on the assessment of self-forgiveness in the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in everyday life. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Eighty-one undergraduates were assigned in 2 groups, where they were presented with different conditions, positive and negative priming, in which participants had to recall in writing three experiences of failing or succeeding; participants then completed 2 IRAPs, 1 targeting feelings and the other targeting outcomes as related to failing and succeeding behaviors. In addition, participants were asked to complete 2 explicit measures that were derived from the 2 IRAPs and another 2 explicit measures that targeted self-compassion and stress, anxiety, and depression. The findings showed that the priming conditions affected the 2 IRAPs differentially. Furthermore, the IRAP that targeted feelings predicted level of self-reported psychopathology but only for participants in the positive priming condition. The findings are discussed in the context of providing tentative evidence for experiential avoidance.

AB  - When derived stimulus relations are established, stimulus functions are altered. The present study aimed to verify whether arbitrary symbols related to meaningful stimuli (facial expressions of happiness) would have their meaning transformed in accordance with relations of sameness or opposition. The experiment started with training to establish the meaning of two contextual cues, one for sameness and one for opposition. Then, using these contextual cues, one pair of stimuli was related as same (B1) or opposite (B2) to six photos containing different people expressing happiness (A stimulus set, A1-A6). Following this training, two other stimuli were related as same (C1) and opposite (C2), respectively, to B1. Participants were tested for derived relations and then the transformation of functions from the happy pictures to B1, B2, C1, and C2 was verified using a semantic differential and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from the semantic differential happy/sad scale, taken together with IRAP, indicated the transformation of stimulus functions: Arbitrary stimuli acquired a meaning similar or opposite to the happy faces, according to the trained or derived relations of sameness or opposition.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - This study aimed to test the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of self-forgiveness response biases related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in everyday life. Unlike previous IRAPs, the stimuli were individualized in that they were based on “problematic” and “non-problematic” behaviors (e.g., procrastination vs. keeping deadlines) that each participant reported at the beginning of the study. Specifically, participants completed two IRAPs. One (the Feelings IRAP) targeted negative and positive feelings experienced while engaging in problematic versus nonproblematic behavior. The other (the Outcomes IRAP) targeted positive and negative outcomes believed to result from this behavior. Participants also completed standardized measures of psychological suffering and self-compassion as well as a questionnaire that targeted the behavior and reactions presented in the IRAPs. While both IRAPs produced response biases that indicated that positive feelings and outcomes were related to nonproblematic behavior, neither produced clear evidence that negative feelings or outcomes were related to problematic behavior. Furthermore, specific response biases on the IRAP (i.e., a tendency to confirm that negative actions lead to negative outcomes) correlated with psychological suffering, particularly depression and stress. The findings suggest that individualized IRAPs, even those that target minor problematic behavior, may be predictive of psychological suffering.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The current study explored implicit attitudes to life and death in a student population using both the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The IAT was similar to one used in previously published researched in the context of the prospective prediction of suicide and self-harm. Two IRAPs were employed, one that assessed relational responses specific to death and life with respect to self, and a second that assessed relational responses specific to evaluations of death and life. The IAT replicated previous results found in normative populations. The IRAPs indicated “prolife” biases, as expected. However, they also failed to demonstrate the presence of strong “antideath” biases, and in one case a specific “death-positive” bias was found. The results observed on the explicit measures did not readily explain the absent or “prodeath” effects observed on the IRAPs. Indeed, participants reported a normative level of anxiety and fear of death. Implications for the study of implicit attitudes to death using the IRAP are considered.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - We examined whether implicit measures of actual and ideal body image can be used to predict body dissatisfaction in young female adults. Participants completed two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning actual (e.g. I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied with their body. Adding further weight to the idea that both IRAP measures captured different underlying constructs, we also observed that they correlated differently with body mass index, explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate relational information relative to implicit measures that allow for an assessment of associative relations only.

AB  - Ang IV is an endogenous peptide generated from the degradation of angiotensin II. Ang II was found to enhance learning and memory in CNS. PKMzeta was identified to be a fragment of PKCzeta (protein kinase Czeta). Its continuous activation was demonstrated to be correlated with the formation of memory in the hippocampus. Therefore, we investigated whether PKMzeta participates in the effects of Ang IV on memory. We first examined the effect of Ang IV on non-spatial memory/cognition in modified object recognition test in rats. Our data showed that Ang IV could increase the exploration time on novel object. The co-administration of ZIP (PKMzeta inhibitor) with Ang IV significantly blocked the effect by Ang IV. The effects of Ang IV on hippocampal LTP at the CA1 region were also evaluated. Ang IV significantly increased the amplitude and slope of the EPSPs, which was consistent with other reports. Surprisingly, instead of potentiating LTP,Ang IV caused a failed maintenance of LTP. Moreover, there was no quantitative change in PKMzeta induced by Ang IV and/or ZIP after behavioral experiments. Taken together, our data re-confirmed the finding of the positive effect of Ang IV to enhance memory/cognition. The increased strength of EPSPs with Ang IV could also have certain functional relevance. Since the behavioral results suggested the involvement of PKMzeta, we hypothesized that the enhancement of memory/cognition by Ang IV may rely on an increase in PKMzeta activity. Overall, the present study provided important advances in our understanding of the action of Ang IV in the hippocampus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used in the area of attractiveness bias and attributions of successfulness. Alternate IRAP trial-blocks required participants to affirm consistent (attractive-successful) and inconsistent (unattractive-successful) relations; shorter mean response latencies across consistent trial-blocks were interpreted as implicit attractiveness.stereotyping. Participants also completed a rating scale for successfulness of attractive versus unattractive individuals. Both implicit and explicit (rating data) data showed statistically significant attractiveness bias for male and female participants. Directionality of bias was analyzed via the IRAP 4 trial-type methodology to determine if it was pro-attractive or anti-unattractive, or if bias was evident.in both directions, or if no bias was shown. For both gender groups, bias was shown to be proattractive.and not antiunattractive.

AU  - Vahey, Nigel A.
AU  - Nicholson, Emma
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and objectives: The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a technique that is attracting a substantial body of research literature, particularly within the clinical domain. Method: In response, the present paper outlines a meta-analysis of clinically-focused IRAP effects (N = 494) to provide the first estimate of how well such effects validate against their respective criterion variables in general. Results: The meta-analysis incorporated clinically-focused IRAP effects from 15 studies yielding a large effect size, (r) over bar = .45, with a desirably narrow 95% credibility interval (.23,.67). The funnel plot and subsequent sensitivity analyses indicated that this meta-effect was not subject to publication bias. Limitations: The present meta-effect is an estimate based upon an IRAP literature that is still evolving rapidly in the clinical domain, and so as per its accompanying credibility interval, all conclusions that follow are necessarily provisional even if bounded. Apart from the fact that the current meta-effect might be subject to inadvertent under- and/or over-estimations of the current literature, the present meta-effect might strengthen with further refinements of the IRAP. Conclusions: The current meta-effect provides the means to calculate what sample size would be required to achieve a statistical power of .80 when testing the criterion validity of clinically-focused IRAP effects using a given parametric statistic. For example, first-order Pearson correlations would hypothetically require an N of 29-37 for such purposes depending upon how conservatively over-estimation of the present meta-effect is controlled for. Overall, the IRAP compares favourably with alternative implicit measures in clinical psychology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the hippocampus, the major somatostatin (SRIF) receptor subtype, the sst2A receptor, is localized at postsynaptic sites of the principal neurons where it modulates neuronal activity. Following agonist exposure, this receptor rapidly internalizes and recycles slowly through the trans-Golgi network. In epilepsy, a high and chronic release of somatostatin occurs, which provokes, in both rat and human tissue, a decrease in the density of this inhibitory receptor at the cell surface. The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is involved in vesicular trafficking and shares common regional distribution with the sst2A receptor. In addition, IRAP ligands display anticonvulsive properties. We therefore sought to assess by in vitro and in vivo experiments in hippocampal rat tissue whether IRAP ligands could regulate the trafficking of the sst2A receptor and, consequently, modulate limbic seizures. Using pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that IRAP ligands accelerate the recycling of the sst2A receptor that has internalized in neurons in vitro or in vivo. Most importantly, because IRAP ligands increase the density of this inhibitory receptor at the plasma membrane, they also potentiate the neuropeptide SRIF inhibitory effects on seizure activity. Our results further demonstrate that IRAP is a therapeutic target for the treatment of limbic seizures and possibly for other neurological conditions in which downregulation of G-protein-coupled receptors occurs.

AB  - The present study was conducted to validate an adaptation of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an indirect latency-based measure of sexual orientation. Furthermore, reliability and criterion validity of the IRAP were compared to two established indirect measures of sexual orientation: a Choice Reaction Time task (CRT) and a Viewing Time (VT) task. A sample of 87 heterosexual and 35 gay men completed all three indirect measures in an online study. The IRAP and the VT predicted sexual orientation nearly perfectly. Both measures also showed a considerable amount of convergent validity. Reliabilities (internal consistencies) reached satisfactory levels. In contrast, the CRT did not tap into sexual orientation in the present study. In sum, the VT measure performed best, with the IRAP showing only slightly lower reliability and criterion validity, whereas the CRT did not yield any evidence of reliability or criterion validity in the present research. The results were discussed in the light of specific task properties of the indirect latency-based measures (task-relevance vs. task-irrelevance).

AU  - Kelly, Michelle E.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - This research aimed to develop the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) as a measure of treatment acceptability and to assess teachers' acceptability of reinforcement and punishment interventions in the presence of “good” and “bad” behaviors. Participants included 15 teachers trained in ABA (ABATs) who worked with children with developmental disabilities, and 15 teachers trained in mainstream primary education (MTs) who worked with typically developing children. On the IRAP, the ABAT group showed proreinforcement biases for all behaviors, while MTs showed a proreinforcement bias for good behavior but a propunishment bias for bad behavior. On explicit measures of acceptability, although both groups showed proreinforcement and antipunishment biases, the ABATs rated reinforcement as significantly more acceptable than the MTs; the ratings of punishment did not differ across the two groups. The research provides support for the IRAP as a measure of treatment acceptability.

TI  - Capitalism Versus a New Economic Model: Implicit and Explicit Attitudes of Protesters and Bankers
AU  - O'Shea, Brian
T2  - SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Why is it difficult to sustain collective action that challenges the political and economic status quo? To develop an answer to this central problem in the study of social movements, this paper investigates the possible role of cognitive mechanisms using the framework of System Justification Theory. It examines the explicit and implicit attitudes of London bankers and Occupy St. Paul's protesters towards capitalism and an alternative economic system (Resource Based Economy: RBE) using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure and questionnaires. As hypothesised, bankers were more likely than protesters to demonstrate positive attitudes towards conservative capitalistic worldviews/values on both explicit and implicit measures. Also as expected, protesters had more positive explicit attitudes towards the RBE than did bankers. However, implicit attitudes towards the RBE were neutral for both groups. The implicit capitalism measures correlated positively with the explicit Capitalism Semantic Differential Scales (SDS) and negatively with the RBE SDS. No correlations were found between the implicit RBE measures and any of the explicit SDSs. The central theoretical insight of this paper is that implicit attitudes play an important role in maintaining the status quo, and that cognitive factors may underpin the resilience of extant social, political and economic structures.

T2  - EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - Purpose: Self-esteem (SE), or one's sense of competence and worth, is reduced in many mental and physical disorders. Low SE is associated with perceived stigma and disability and poor treatment outcomes. The present study examined implicit and explicit SE (automatic and deliberate views about the self) in people with epilepsy and people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs). Discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE have been found to correlate with psychological distress in disorders often associated with PNESs but are relatively unexplored in PNESs. We hypothesized that, compared with epilepsy, PNESs would be associated with lower self-reported SE and greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE. Methods: Thirty adults with PNESs, 25 adults with epilepsy, and 31 controls without a history of seizures were asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale as a measure of explicit SE and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of implicit SE. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (a somatic symptom inventory) were also administered. Results: We found significant group differences in explicit (p < 0.001) but not implicit SE. Patients with PNESs reported lower SE than the other groups. No group differences were found in implicit SE. Implicit-explicit SE discrepancies were larger in the group with PNESs than in the other groups (p < 0.001). Higher frequency of PNESs (but not epileptic seizures) was associatedwith lower explicit SE (r(s) = -.83, p < 0.01) and greater SE discrepancies (i.e., lower explicit relative to implicit SE; r(s) = .65, p < 0.01). These relationships remained significant when controlling for anxiety and somatization. Conclusion: Patients with PNESs had lower explicit SE than those with epilepsy or healthy controls. In keeping with our expectations, there were greater discrepancies between implicit SE and explicit SE among patients with PNESs than in the other groups. Our results, including the strong relationship between PNES frequency, anxiety, and explicit-implicit SE discrepancies, support the interpretation that PNESs serve to reduce cognitive dissonance, perhaps protecting patients' implicit SE.

AB  - Medical school organizations are incredibly complex entities operating within multifaceted systems that exert multiple environmental pressures on the internal practices of the schools. Moreover, the components of medical schools operate within the contingencies of the medical school as a whole, such as the recent curricular change that occurred at the University of Nevada School of Medicine. That change required organizational and cultural changes in many different areas within the school and at all levels of the school's organizational hierarchy. Three separate studies were conducted during this time of transition to evaluate the practices of major stakeholders within the organization: emerging leader interviews and a Faculty Forward((c)) survey for faculty and the application of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure for students. The results are depictive of ways by which behavioral systemic assessments can serve as important tools for guiding comprehensive and empirically based success in complex organizational systems.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Relational Frame Theory (RFT) is a functional-analytic account of human language and cognition, including human psychopathology. The core premise of the theory is that language and cognition is composed of relational acts. Over the past 10 years, the theory has served to generate the development of a measure, known as the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, which was designed initially to provide a metric of the strength or persistence of relational responding. Although the IRAP provides a measure of implicit attitudes, we argue that it is time to refocus on its original purpose: measuring the strength of relational framing. This refocusing has already started to generate a new conceptual framework, which potentially will lead to improved functional specificity for behavior therapy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) utilizes cognitive defusion strategies to alter the function of unwanted, distressing thoughts so as to reduce their impact and foster greater psychological flexibility. Though defusion is linked to several positive outcomes (e.g., reduced thought believability, improved pain tolerance), it remains unclear whether such effects are associated with the behavioral process of defusion itself; namely, behavior that is relatively broad and flexible compared with behavior that is narrow and inflexible. To address this issue, the present study assessed the impact of a defusion intervention on behavior, as measured by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Undergraduates high in spider fear (N = 65) were randomly assigned to one of two interventions targeting phobic thoughts of spiders: a defusion intervention or a thought distraction intervention. A control condition (reading an article) was used to evaluate the relative impact of both interventions. Participants completed the IRAP and rating scales of believability and distress of target thoughts pre- and post-intervention. Consistent with expectation, defusion produced significantly greater pre- to post-intervention reductions in IRAP effects and thought believability relative to comparison conditions. The practical and scientific implications of the present findings, suggesting that defused behavior is broad and flexible relative to narrow and inflexible, are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Previous research indicates that educational courses and occupations tend to become associated with one gender more than another. This can be seen within the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) in particular, with men often more strongly associated with these areas than women. Even when individuals claim to hold gender-neutral beliefs about STEM, research has found they may still hold implicit beliefs that are gender-biased. Two implicit measures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared to assess attitudes towards women and science-based versus liberal arts college subjects. The results of the IAT suggested a tendency to associate `men' rather than `women' with `science' for both male and female participants. The IRAP produced a more complex pattern of results, with females showing a tendency to pair men with science and with liberal arts, whereas the males showed a more neutral effect. The findings have implications for those concerned with addressing the gender imbalance in STEM careers. (C) 2015 Association for Contextual Behavioral Science. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mainstream implicit cognition measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) have produced a substantial volume of data on political attitudes. However, the associative basis of most implicit measures entail interpretive limitations that may be avoided with a relatively new measure known as the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The IRAP is a measure of arbitrarily applicable relational repertoires based on a functional and contextual view of cognition. The current study used the IRAP to assess relational repertoires among college undergraduates in respect to images of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney presented in conjunction with positive and negative evaluative words. The results showed distinct patterns of bias on the IRAP that correlated with various political self-reports. The IRAP also distinguished self-reported intentions to vote for Obama or Romney. Some of the results revealed patterns that would not be apparent with a comparable IAT. The current study provides a supportive basis for the reliability and convergent validity of the IRAP for measuring implicit perceptions of political candidates.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - This study aimed to develop the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of response biases related to emotional reactions and expected outcomes in the context of minor failings and successes in everyday life. Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP. Sixty undergraduates completed two IRAPs and the explicit measures. The pattern of biases observed across the implicit and explicit measures diverged, and the correlations between the two types of measures were either absent or relatively weak. The results suggest that implicit measures may provide an additional source of information concerning self-forgiveness beyond that provided by explicit self-report measures per se.

T2  - BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL ISSUES
AB  - Racial evaluations have received considerable attention by researchers of implicit cognition, especially with the Implicit Association Test (IAT). The IAT measures associative biases in a relativistic manner, whereby attitudes toward a given racial category are compared to attitudes toward another. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a new behavior analytic measure of cognition that may provide a less relativistic and more specific measure of cognitive repertoires. The current study utilized a race IRAP to assess evaluative biases among a balanced sample of Black and White undergraduates. The race IRAP was administered twice in a row in conjunction with a collection of self-report measures of racial attitudes. Results for reliability and convergent validity were generally supportive. Furthermore, observed biases appeared to reflect positive in-group biases rather than derogatory attitudes toward the out-group, an effect that would not be apparent with a similarly configured race IAT. Future research may benefit from consideration of the evaluative content of the IRAP as well as the racial demographics for both the participants and the experimenters.

We studied the ability of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan to cure or prevent AD hallmarks in aged (similar to 18 months at endpoint, 3 months treatment) or adult (similar to 12 months at endpoint, 10 months treatment) human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We tested learning and memory with the Morris water maze, and evaluated neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling using [F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET and laser Doppler flowmetry responses to whisker stimulation. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed with on-line videomicroscopy. We measured protein levels of oxidative stress enzymes (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox), and quantified soluble and deposited amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AngII receptors AT1 and AT2, angiotensin IV receptor AT4, and cortical cholinergic innervation. In aged APP mice, losartan did not improve learning but it consolidated memory acquisition and recall, and rescued neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling and cerebrovascular dilatory capacity. Losartan normalized cerebrovascular p67phox and SOD2 protein levels and up-regulated those of SOD1. Losartan attenuated astrogliosis, normalized AT1 and AT4 receptor levels, but failed to rescue the cholinergic deficit and the A beta pathology. Given preventively, losartan protected cognitive function, cerebrovascular reactivity, and AT4 receptor levels. Like in aged APP mice, these benefits occurred without a decrease in soluble A beta species or plaque load. We conclude that losartan exerts potent preventive and restorative effects on AD hallmarks, possibly by mitigating AT1-initiated oxidative stress and normalizing memory-related AT4 receptors.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a widely used measure of implicit cognition which has detected biases pertaining to various psychological constructs from spider fear to cocaine dependence. One issue which emerges in the IRAP literature is that of participants failing to meet or uphold the necessary criteria to complete the IRAP, which results in their elimination from the study, which can be rather detrimental to results. The present study sought to delineate which factors may contribute to high attrition rates in IRAP research. A previously used IRAP measuring spider fear was employed along with an n-back task and a series of questionnaires. Results indicated that the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and focus attention on the task at hand was the best predictor of accuracy on the IRAP, irrespective of spider fear or current levels of anxiety. These results are promising for the use of the IRAP in clinically-relevant domains as they suggest that the psychopathology of participants does not affect performance on the IRAP.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The current study was largely exploratory and sought to begin the development of a measure of implicit forgiveness of self related to “minor” transgressions (mistakes, flaws, shortcomings) versus the forgiveness of others. Forty-seven students completed a scale designed to measure forgiveness of self and others using the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). The results indicated that the measure of implicit forgiveness diverged from an explicit measure designed to measure the same construct. The key finding was that participants tended to be more forgiving toward themselves than toward others at an implicit level, but on an explicit measure, participants rated their own failures as less acceptable than the failures of others. Overall, the findings suggest that it may be useful to supplement explicit measures of forgiveness with implicit measures in future research.

T2  - EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - This study examined implicit and explicit anxiety in individuals with epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) and explored whether these constructs were related to experiential avoidance and seizure frequency. Based on recent psychological models of PNESs, it was hypothesized that nonepileptic seizures would be associated with implicit and explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance. Explicit anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; implicit anxiety was measured by an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; and experiential avoidance was measured with the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire. Although both groups with epilepsy and PNESs scored similarly on implicit measures of anxiety, significant implicit-explicit anxiety discrepancies were only identified in patients with PNESs (p < .001). In the group with PNESs (but not in the group with epilepsy), explicit anxiety correlated with experiential avoidance (r = .63, p < .01) and frequency of seizures (r = .67, p < .01); implicit anxiety correlated with frequency of seizures only (r = .56, p < .01). Our findings demonstrate the role of implicit anxiety in PNESs and provide additional support for the contribution of explicit anxiety and experiential avoidance to this disorder.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used for assessing implicit attitudes across different domains. The current study aimed to investigate whether the IRAP is an adequate measure to assess children's implicit gender-based attitudes toward toys (dolls and toy cars). Although the software parameters used were taken from previous adult studies, children performed successfully in the task. The strongest IRAP effect found was for relations between dolls and girls (i.e., participants responded faster when relating dolls-girls-match than dolls-boys-match). Additionally, children's response latencies were longer for pairings of dolls and boys than for pairings of toy cars and girls. These findings seem to confirm that the IRAP is sensitive to gender-stereotyped relations established in children and may be a useful tool in providing additional information to complement explicit measures in children's attitudes.

T2  - CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB  - Research using explicit measures has linked decreased positive future thinking, but not increased negative future thinking, with clinical depression. However, individuals may be unable or unwilling to express thoughts about the future, and can be unaware of implicit beliefs that can influence their behavior. Implicit measures of cognition may shed light on the role of future thinking in depression. To our knowledge, the current study presents the first implicit measure of positive and negative future thinking. A sample of 71 volunteers (38 healthy; 33 with sub-clinical depression) completed both implicit and explicit measures of positive and negative future thinking. The findings indicate differences in the evaluation of both positive and negative future events between the two groups. However, group differences were more pronounced on the implicit measure. These findings point to the potential utility of an implicit measure of future thinking in mental health research and clinical practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxytocin is a neuromodulator with antidepressant-like effects. In vitro, oxytocin is rapidly cleaved by insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Oxytocin metabolites are known to exert strong central activities that are different from the effects of the parent molecule. Our goal is to investigate in vivo whether IRAP deletion modifies the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice, IRAP wild-type (IRAP(+/+)) and knock-out (IRAP(-/-)) mice were injected subcutaneously with saline, oxytocin or oxytocin combined with angiotensin IV. One hour after injection, immobility was timed during a 5 min forced swim that was preceded by an open field to study locomotor behaviour. Oxytocin induced antidepressant-like effects in male (0.25 mg/kg oxytocin) and female (0.15 mg/kg oxytocin) C57Bl/6 mice subjected to the forced swim test. Oxytocin did not influence locomotor behaviour in mice, as shown with the open field. These findings were reproduced in transgenic male (aged 3-6 months) and female (aged 12-18 months) IRAP(+/+) mice. However, the major findings of our study were that the antidepressant-like effect was reversed in angiotensin IV treated IRAP(+/+) mice and was completely absent in age- and gender-matched IRAP(-/-) mice. The lack of an antidepressant-like effect of oxytocin in young male and middle-aged female IRAP(-/-) mice attributes an important role to IRAP in mediating this effect.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Bortoloti and de Rose (2009) found evidence that the level of functional transfer is higher in equivalence classes generated by delayed matching to sample (DMTS) than in classes generated by simultaneous matching (SMTS). We attempted to replicate these findings with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Two experimental groups established two equivalence classes, each comprised of faces expressing either anger or happiness and nonsense words. The classes were established with SMTS for one group and with DMTS for the other. Then, nonsense words and the faces were respectively presented as “attribute” and target stimuli in IRAP tasks. The DMTS group yielded the expected IRAP effect; the SMTS group yielded an IRAP effect only when the target was a happy face. It is discussed that DMTS can enhance transfer of “semantic” functions between equivalent stimuli, supporting the idea that the relatedness of stimuli can vary as a function of experimental parameters.

AB  - A broad implicit measure of depressive emotional reactions was created by mapping the content of the depression scale from the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) on to the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were asked to relate pairings of antecedents and emotional reactions that followed the formula “When X happens . . . feel Y.” Groups of participants representing the low and high extremes of normative levels of depressive symptoms completed an IRAP before and after a sad mood induction procedure. At baseline both groups produced a positive emotional response bias on the IRAP. After the sad mood induction, the “normal” group showed no change, whereas the “mild/moderate” depression group showed a significant decrease in the poisitivity of their emotional responses. A similar pattern of differential change was found when groups were created using scores on the AAQ-II. The findings are related to the broader literature on cognitive reactivity and implications for future research are considered.

AU  - Nicholson, Emma
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and objectives: There is increasing evidence that disgust responding occurs at both a primary and secondary level in the form of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. The unique contributions of anxiety and disgust need to be established if disgust is to be implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary objective of the current study was to develop two separate implicit measures of disgust propensity and sensitivity and to explicate the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in avoidance behavior and OC tendencies. Methods: The current study (N = 33 undergraduate students) utilized a measure of implicit cognition, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to independently analyze disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. In addition, a series of behavioral approach tasks (BAT) and questionnaires measuring general disgust, obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies and general psychopathology were implemented to validate the implicit measures. Results: Disgust sensitivity predicted avoidance behavior on the BATs independent of disgust propensity and anxiety: while disgust propensity did not. Both disgust propensity and sensitivity predicted self-reported OC tendencies and individually predicted obsessing and washing concerns, respectively. Limitations: Our findings are based on a non-clinical student sample and further research is required for generalization to OCD. Conclusions: The implicit measures appeared to be measuring two separate constructs and had differential relationships with behavior and OC tendencies. Overall, the results support current theories relating to pathological disgust and OCD. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Subjects completed a baseline stimulus matching procedure designed to produce two symmetrical stimulus relations; A1-B1 and A2-B2. Using A1, B1, and two novel stimuli, subjects were then trained to produce a common key-press response for two stimuli and a second key-press response for two further stimuli across two blocks of response training. During one block, the reinforcement contingencies were consistent with baseline relations (i.e., A1 and B1 shared a response function), whereas during the other block they were not. Thirteen of 18 subjects who completed the procedure showed a response class acquisition rate differential across the two test blocks in the predicted direction. It is suggested that this procedure may serve as a behavior analytic alternative to popular implicit tests. It provides a nonrelative measure of stimulus association strength and may display superior procedural implicitness over other tests.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin IV (Ang IV) provides protection against brain injury caused by cerebral ischemia. Ang IV is a potent inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Therefore, we examined the effect of IRAP gene inactivation on neuroprotection following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in mice. IRAP knockout mice and wild-type controls were subjected to 2 h of transient MCAo using the intraluminal filament technique. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, neurological deficits of the stroke-induced mice were assessed and infarct volumes were measured by TTC staining. The cerebral infarct volume was significantly reduced in the IRAP knockout mice compared to wild-type littermates with corresponding improvement in neurological performance at 24 h post-ischemia. An increase in compensatory cerebral blood flow during MCAo was observed in the IRAP knockout animals with no differences in cerebral vascular anatomy detected. The current study demonstrates that deletion of the IRAP gene protects the brain from ischemic damage analogous to the effect of the IRAP inhibitor, Ang IV. This study indicates that IRAP is potentially a new therapeutic target for the development of treatment for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial interventions for substance dependence have demonstrated efficacy. However, the mechanisms by which specific intervention strategies exert their effect have not been clearly identified. Objective: This study investigated the prospective relationships between two psychological processes, an attentional bias toward cocaine stimuli and beliefs about the consequences of cocaine use, and treatment outcome. Method: Twenty-five cocaine-dependent participants enrolled in a 6-month outpatient treatment program that included voucher incentives for abstinence. All participants were asked to complete two implicit assessment procedures, a Drug Stroop protocol and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as well as explicit measures of cocaine craving and the consequences of cocaine use, prior to beginning treatment. Pearson's correlation coefficients tested the prospective relationships between treatment outcome and the implicit and explicit assessments. Results: Stronger implicit beliefs about the positive effects of cocaine use prior to treatment were associated with poorer treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was in place. Further, an attentional bias for cocaine-related stimuli was associated with better treatment outcome when an escalating voucher-incentive program was removed. No association between cocaine use beliefs and treatment outcome was found when beliefs were measured with self-report instruments. Conclusions and scientific significance: These findings highlight the potential utility of performance-based measures for delineating the psychological mechanisms associated with variation in response to treatment for drug dependence.

AB  - Facial electromyography (EMG) was used to gauge emotional responding towards images of slim and overweight individuals, and findings were compared with data from a series of alternative measures including two implicit attitudinal procedures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit measures of anti-fat prejudice and discriminatory behavior. Images of slim individuals elicited EMG responses consistent with more positive affect. Data from both the IRAP and IAT indicated higher levels of bias than were revealed on the explicit measures, and the IRAP also corroborated the EMG pattern by indicating responses consistent with pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias. The IRAP was moderately correlated with both EMG and the IAT and was the only measure to predict behavioral intentions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY
AB  - The peptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) influences seizure susceptibility in rat and mouse models. Indeed, Ang IV has been shown to protect rats from limbic seizures in the focal pilocarpine model. Moreover, both anticonvulsive and antiepileptogenic effects of Ang IV have been reported in the acute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and kindling model of generalized seizures in mice. It has been hypothesized that the latter effects on seizures could be established via a modulatory effect on dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia or via an indirect interaction between Ang IV and adenosine A1 receptors. However, a possible role for insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), the high affinity binding site for Ang IV, has not been studied yet. To unequivocally unravel the involvement of IRAP in generalized seizure generation, we investigated the susceptibility of male IRAP wild-type (IRAP(+/+)) and knock-out (IRAP(-/-)) mice to PTZ-induced seizures. Challenging these mice intravenously with PTZ resulted in significantly increased thresholds for myoclonic twitch and generalized clonic seizures with loss of righting reflexes in IRAP(-/-) mice compared to their IRAP(+/+) littermates. These behavioural data were confirmed by video-electrocorticography monitoring. Our study shows that IRAP(-/-) mice are less sensitive to the development of PTZ-induced seizures and suggests that IRAP is involved in generalized seizure generation.

T2  - EATING BEHAVIORS
AB  - The freshman year of college has been identified as a time when some students experience large changes in their eating behaviors, body image, and weight. One factor that is predictive of changes in these variables is internalization of the thin ideal (i.e., the degree to which an individual has accepted societal values of thinness and applies these values to herself). However, given the limitation of self-report and previous research demonstrating the additional predictive validity implicit measurement provides, it may be important to develop an implicit paradigm for assessing internalization of the thin ideal. The Implicit Association Test is the most common implicit measurement technique. However this test is associational in nature, which reflects only one aspect of human cognition. The current study evaluates a newly-created implicit measure of internalization of the thin ideal that utilizes the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In particular, the study investigates concurrent and prospective associations between internalization of the thin ideal and disordered eating, body image dissatisfaction, and weight in a group of women at the beginning and end of their freshman year in college. Results of the study indicate that weight, disordered eating and body image dissatisfaction increased during the freshman year, and that these were predicted by implicit internalization of the thin ideal at the beginning of the year. Moreover, the new implicit measure was predictive above and beyond any predictive ability of the explicit measure. Results indicate that the thin ideal IRAP can successfully predict changes in many variables of interest at the freshman year of college, and suggest it may be a beneficial screening tool to assess at-risk freshman. This study also highlights the need for additional implicit measures in the realm of body image and disordered eating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research increasingly supports the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure capable of providing a sensitive index of preexisting implicit attitudes and cognitions. The current study constitutes the first attempt to determine if the IRAP is also sensitive to implicit attitudes engineered through either direct relational training or verbal instruction. Following attitude-induction training, participants completed an IRAP in addition to two self-report procedures designed to measure newly formed attitudes. Both implicit and explicit attitudes emerged and persisted in response to both relational training and verbal instruction. Furthermore, the IRAP data indicated significant implicit attitudes when participants both affirmed attitude-consistent and negated attitude-inconsistent relations. The findings are consistent with previous attitude-formation research, but the relational properties of the IRAP raise specific conceptual issues pertaining to the nature of implicit attitudes themselves.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - In the present article we re-examine one of the most deeply entrenched assumptions in modern attitude research, namely, that implicit social cognition is a product of associations between mental representations. More precisely, we argue that the analysis of implicit social cognition in psychology is curtailed by the widespread adoption of the associative assumption. We open with a brief overview of the attitude literature, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental structure, measurement, and conceptual differences that have emerged between implicit and explicit attitudes in recent times. Thereafter we address the influence of the associative assumption in shaping our methodologies, research questions, and theories regarding implicit and explicit attitudes. In the third and final section, we offer two alternative and perhaps complementary nonassociative models for understanding implicit cognition. While the first model situates its explanation at the mental (propositional) level of analysis and the second at the functional, each potentially allows for novel theoretical and empirical predictions and insight into attitudes above and beyond the boundaries of traditional associationism.

AB  - Inflammatory and ischemic processes contribute to the development of secondary brain damage after mechanical brain injury. Recent data suggest that thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs approved for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, effectively reduces inflammation and brain lesion by stimulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). The present study investigates the influence of the TZD pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on inflammation and secondary brain damage after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). A controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was induced in male C57BL/6 mice to investigate following endpoints: (1) mRNA expression of PPAR-gamma and PPAR-gamma target genes (LPL, GLT1, and IRAP/Lnpep), and inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and iNOS), at 15 min, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-trauma; (2) contusion volume, neurological function, and gene expression after 24 h in mice treated with pioglitazone (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) or rosiglitazone (5 and 10 mg/kg IP at 30 min post-trauma); and (3) the role of PPAR-gamma to mediate protection was determined in animals treated with pioglitazone, the PPAR-gamma inhibitor T0070907, and a combination of both. Inflammatory marker genes, but not PPAR-gamma gene expression, was up-regulated after trauma. Pioglitazone reduced the histological damage and inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, rosiglitazone failed to suppress inflammation and histological damage. PPAR-gamma and PPAR-gamma target gene expression was not induced by pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. In line with these results, pioglitazone-mediated protection was not reversed by T0070907. The results indicate that the neuroprotective effects of pioglitazone are not solely related to PPAR-gamma-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - Individuals in the early stage of Parkinson's disease exhibit cognitive impairments as a result of hemisphere damage. The mesocortical dopamine system, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is implicated in cognitive functions and is characterized by an asymmetric organization. Oxytocinase activity (ox) is also asymmetrically distributed in the mPFC of normal rats and is involved in cognitive functions. OX was measured in the left and right mPFC of rats with left or right hemi-parkinsonism, induced by intrastriatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine, and compared with sham controls. These results demonstrated that the striking basal left predominance of OX observed in both the left and the right sham controls was radically disrupted in lesioned animals. The bilateral distribution in lesioned animals was altered differently depending on the injured hemisphere. These results may reflect changes in the enzyme substrates and consequently in the functions in which they are involved. These results may account, in part, for the cognitive abnormalities observed in hemi-parkinsonism. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current research comprised two experiments that employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of implicit racial attitudes. White Irish participants were exposed to blocks of trials that involved responding in a manner consistent with either a pro-white stereotype or a pro-black stereotype. In Experiment 1, participants completed the IRAP in either a public or private assessment situation. It was hypothesized that implicit pro-white stereotyping would decrease in the public context relative to the private context. The results, however, were not in accordance with this prediction. A second experiment was conducted to determine if requiring participants to respond in a public context but within a shorter time frame would impact significantly upon implicit stereotyping. The results showed that a reduction in response latency significantly increased ingroup stereotyping. The findings appear to be consistent with the relational elaboration and coherence model.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a relatively new measure of implicit cognition that tests cognition as relational behavior instead of an associative activity and thus may provide a more specific measure of cognitive repertoires, including those for social biases, than better known implicit measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). A small body of IRAP research provides tentative evidence for this measure's potential. The current study adds to this research by using the IRAP to assess for social biases for race, religion, gender, and obesity. Overall results show medium to large effect sizes for all conditions except obesity, as well as interesting trends at the trial-type level. These outcomes and possible future directions of IRAP research are discussed.

Study 1 utilized the IRAP with female college students to examine self-referential beliefs regarding body image. Results revealed positive associations between self-referential beliefs on the IRAP and explicit measures of body image satisfaction and acceptance, likelihood of dieting, and internalization of the thin ideal. In Study 2, an IRAP measuring general self-esteem revealed positive correlations between IRAP performance and explicit measures of psychological functioning and negative correlations between the IRAP and psychopathology. Results are discussed in terms of the potential utility of this theoretically grounded implicit measure in assessing self-concept.

The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), the conceptual basis of which was derived from relational frame theory, is offered as a methodology that may be used in the experimental analysis of implicit attitudes and beliefs. The relational elaboration and coherence (REC) model provides a possible relational-frame account of the findings that have emerged from the IRAP. The article first outlines the research history that led to the development of the IRAP, followed by a description of the method. The REC model and how it explains a range of IRAP data are then considered. The article also outlines how both the IRAP and the REC model overlap with, and differ from, similar research found in the non-behavior-analytic literature.

AB  - Two measures of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), were compared with each other and with a measure of explicit attitudes in the assessment of implicit pro-slim/anti-fat bias. Results from both implicit tests indicated higher levels of bias than revealed by the explicit measure. The IRAP data suggested that it was participants' pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias, which was driving this effect. Explicit attitudes and feelings towards the overweight were significant predictors of behavioural intentions towards the overweight with the IRAP offering a greater contribution to predictive validity than the IAT.

AB  - P>Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of angiotensin IV (Ang IV) or Leu-Val-Val-haemorphin 7 (LVV-H7) improves memory performance in normal rats and reverses memory deficits in rat models for cognitive impairment. These memory effects were believed to be mediated via the putative `AT4 receptor'. However, this binding site was identified as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Correspondingly, Ang IV and LVV-H7 were characterised as IRAP inhibitors. This study investigates whether and how IRAP may be involved in the central effects of Ang IV and LVV-H7. We determined the effects of i.c.v. administration of Ang IV or LVV-H7 on hippocampal neurotransmitter levels using microdialysis in rats. We observed that Ang IV modulates hippocampal acetylcholine levels, whereas LVV-H7 does not. This discrepancy was reflected in the observation that Ang IV binds with micromolar affinity to the AT1 receptor whereas no binding affinity was observed for LVV-H7. Correspondingly, we demonstrated that the AT1 receptor is involved in the effects of Ang IV on hippocampal neurotransmitter levels and on spatial working memory in a plus maze spontaneous alternation task. However, the AT1 receptor was not involved in the spatial memory facilitating effect of LVV-H7. Finally, we demonstrated that Ang IV did not diffuse to the hippocampus following i.c.v. injection, suggesting an extrahippocampal site of action. We propose that AT1 receptors are implicated in the neurochemical and cognitive effects of Ang IV, whereas LVV-H7 may mediate its effects via IRAP.

Response latency data gathered from both the IAT and the IRAP discriminated at a statistically significant level between vegetarians and meat-eaters.

In this study, the IRAP was used to assess implicit attitudes toward “mainstream” sexual terms (e.g., Kissing) and “BDSM” terms (e.g., Bondage) among individuals reporting BDSM interests and among students who did not report such interests. A questionnaire was used to measure explicit attitudes toward the same sexual terms as well as self-reported sexual behaviors. Results showed that the Student group generally displayed pro-mainstream attitudes, while the BDSM group displayed pro-BDSM attitudes. These effects were mirrored in the questionnaire results, which provides support for the IRAP as a potentially useful tool in measuring participant attitudes toward complex sexual stimuli.

AB  - The AT(4) ligands, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, elicit robust effects on facilitating memory by binding to a specific site in the brain historically termed the angiotensin AT(4) receptor. The identification of the AT(4) receptor as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is controversial, with other proteins speculated to be the target(s) of these peptides. In this study we have utilized IRAP knockout mice to investigate IRAP in the brain. We demonstrate that the high-affinity binding site for angiotensin IV is absent in IRAP knockout mice brain sections in parallel with the loss of IRAP immunostaining, providing irrefutable proof that IRAP is the specific high-affinity binding site for AT(4) ligands. However, our characterization of the behavioural phenotype of the IRAP knockout mice revealed a totally unexpected finding. In contrast to the acute effects of IRAP inhibitors in enhancing memory, deletion of the IRAP gene resulted in mice with an accelerated, age-related decline in spatial memory that was only detected in the Y maze paradigm. Moreover, no alterations in behaviour of the IRAP knockout mice were observed that could assist in elucidating the endogenous substrate(s). Our results highlight the importance of analysing the behavioural phenotype of knockout mice across different ages and in distinct memory paradigms.

AB  - Participants completed a before/after and a similar/different relational task, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRA P), and subsequently took the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT). For each relational task, response latencies were measured first on consistent trials, where participants responded in accordance with preestablished verbal relations, and then on inconsistent trials, where they responded against these relations. A difference-score was calculated by subtracting consistent from inconsistent response latencies. The inconsistent trials and the difference-score provided measures of relational flexibility. Results showed that faster responding on the IRAP and smaller difference-scores predicted higher IQ. These findings suggest that relational flexibility is an important component of intelligence and might therefore be targeted in educational settings.

AB  - The current study examined the malleability of implicit attitudes using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). In Experiment 1, “similar” and “opposite” were presented as response options with the sample terms “old people” and “young people” and various positive and negative target stimuli. Results showed significantly faster response latencies for consistent (e.g., Similar Positive-Young People) compared to inconsistent tasks (e.g., Similar-Positive-Old People). Explicit measures did not correlate with this IRAP effect. Experiment 2 determined whether prior exposure to pictures of admired and disliked old and young individuals had an impact on IRAP performance. Results revealed that pro-old exemplars reduced the pro-young IRAP effect, but reversed the ann-old effect, and this held for 24 h; explicit measures were largely unaffected. The findings suggest that the IRAP provides an informative measure of attitude change following pro- versus anti-exemplar training.

AB  - The IRAP ligands Angiotensin IV (Ang IV) and LVV-haemorphin 7 (LVV-H7) enhance performance in a range of memory paradigms in normal rats and ameliorate memory deficits in rat models for amnesia. The mechanism by which these peptides facilitate memory remains to be elucidated. In recent in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that Ang IV and LVV-H7 potentiate activity-evoked glucose uptake into hippocampal neurons. This raises the possibility that TRAP ligands may facilitate memory in hippocampus-dependent tasks through enhancement of hippocampal glucose uptake. Acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 1 nmol Ang IV or 0.1 nmol LVV-H7 in 3 months-old Sprague-Dawley rats enhanced spatial working memory in the plus maze spontaneous alternation task. Extracellular hippocampal glucose levels were monitored before, during and after behavioral testing using in vivo microdialysis. Extracellular hippocampal glucose levels decreased significantly to about 70% of baseline when the animals explored the plus maze, but remained constant when the animals were placed into a novel control chamber. Ang IV and LVV-H7 did not significantly alter hippocampal glucose levels compared to control animals in the plus maze or control chamber. Both peptides had no effect on hippocampal blood flow as determined by laser Doppler flowmetry, excluding that either peptide increased the hippocampal supply of glucose. We demonstrated for the first time that Ang IV and LVV-H7 enhance spatial working memory in the plus maze spontaneous alternation task but no in vivo evidence was found for enhanced hippocampal glucose uptake or blood flow.

AB  - The study examined the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure's (IRAP) validity as a computerized response-latency-based measure of implicit self-esteem. University undergraduates and 2 sets of convicted prisoners participated. One set of prisoners resided in the main block, and the other in a privileged lower security “open area” of a medium-security Irish prison. The IRAP required participants to maintain relational responses that were self-positive on half of the IRAP trials (”Consistent”), and self-negative on the other half (”Inconsistent”). As predicted, the students and the prisoners in the open area showed stronger IRAP effects (shorter latencies during consistent vs. inconsistent trials) than the main block prisoners. Additionally, the IRAP's convergent validity was supported by its moderate positive correlation with an explicit self-esteem measure. The findings provide preliminary support for the analytic utility of the IRAP and suggest future avenues of investigation afforded by the IRAP's design.

AB  - Researchers have proposed that the cognitive distortions of sexual offenders are underpinned by a number of implicit cognitive processes termed implicit theories. Until recently, however, the implicit theory hypothesis has received little empirical support due to broader limitations with standard forensic assessment procedures. The current research aimed to determine whether a new assessment methodology, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), could provide further evidence for Ward and Keenan's (1999) children as sexual beings implicit theory. The results indicated that the IRAP was significantly more effective at identifying core implicit differences between sexual offenders against children and nonoffenders than a cognitive distortion questionnaire. Furthermore, although both groups demonstrated an overall response bias towards adults as sexual and children as nonsexual, this bias was significantly impaired in the sexual offender group. The findings are discussed in relation to previous implicit theory research and recommendations for the development of implicit methodologies are made.

AB  - The current article reports the first attempt to test the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), as a group-based measure of natural verbal relations, using both response-latency and event-related potentials as dependent variables. On each trial of the IRAP, participants were presented with I of 2 attribute stimuli (”Pleasant” or “Unpleasant”), a positive (e.g., “Love”) or negative (e.g., “Murder”) target stimulus, and 2 relational terms, “Similar” and “Opposite,” as response options. Participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible across blocks of trials, with half of the blocks requiring responses that were deemed consistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love-Similar), and the other half inconsistent (e.g., Pleasant-Love- Opposite), with natural verbal relations. Shorter mean latencies were predicted for consistent than for inconsistent blocks. Two separate experiments supported this prediction. Event-related potentials, gathered during the second experiment, also proved to be sensitive to the IRAP, yielding more negative waveforms for inconsistent relative to consistent blocks of trials. A theoretical interpretation of the IRAP effect is offered, and important directions for future research are highlighted.

AB  - It is proposed that insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is the site of action of two peptides, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, which have facilitatory effects on learning and memory. In fat and muscles, IRAP codistributes with the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in specialised vesicles, where it plays a role in the tethering and/or trafficking of these vesicles. This study investigated whether an analogous system exists in two functionally distinct regions of the brain, the hippocampus and the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, IRAP was found in the pyramidal neurones where it exhibited a high degree of colocalisation with GLUT4. Consistent with the role of GLUT4 in insulin-responsive tissues, the glucose transporter was thought to be responsible for facilitating glucose uptake into these pyramidal neurones in response to potassium-induced depolarisation or cAMP activation as the glucose influx was sensitive to indinavir treatment. Angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 enhanced this activity-dependent glucose uptake in hippocampal slices. In contrast, in the cerebellum, where the distribution of IRAP was dissociated from GLUT4, the effect of the peptides on glucose uptake was absent. We propose that the modulation of glucose uptake by angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 is region-specific and is critically dependent on a high degree of colocalisation between IRAP and GLUT4. These findings also confirm a role for IRAP and GLUT4 in activity-dependent glucose uptake in hippocampal neurones.

AB  - Angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 promote robust enhancing effects on learning and memory. These peptides are also competitive inhibitors of the insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase, suggesting that the biological actions of these peptides may result from inhibition of IRAP activity. However, the normal function of IRAP in the brain is yet to be determined. The present study investigated the sub-cellular distribution of IRAP in four neuronal cell lines and in the mouse brain. Using sub-cellular fractionation, IRAP was found to be enriched in low density microsomes, while lower levels of IRAP were also present in high density microsomes, plasma membrane and mitochondrial fractions. Dual-label immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of IRAP in vesicles colocalized with the vesicular maker VAMP2, in the trans Golgi network co-localized with TGN 38 and in endosomes co- localized with EEA1. Finally using electron microscopy, IRAP specific immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with large 100-200 nm vesicles in hippocampal neurons. The location, appearance and size of these vesicles are consistent with neurosecretory vesicles. IRAP precipitate was also detected in intracellular structures including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi stack and mitochondrial membranes. The sub-cellular localization of IRAP in neurons demonstrated in the present study bears striking parallels with distribution of IRAP in insulin responsive cells, where the enzyme plays a role in insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Therefore, we propose that the function of IRAP in neurons may be similar to that in insulin responsive cells.

AB  - Locally administered angiotensin IV causes a dose-dependent increase of the dopamine levels in the striatum of the rat. The aminopeptidases insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and/or aminopeptidase N (AP-N) are proposed to be involved in this effect since both enzymes are inhibited by angiotensin IV. In agreement with this hypothesis we demonstrate that by using the AP-N selective inhibitor 7B, about 60% of the aminopeptidase activity in striatal membranes could be attributed to AP-N (pK(i)=9.20). Higher concentrations of 713 are capable of inhibiting IRAP as well (pK(i)=7.26). Interestingly, in vivo, inhibition of IRAP or AP-N activity does not appear to be involved in the angiotensin IV-mediated effect in the striatum since 7B itself is not capable to induce dopamine release such as observed with angiotensin IV. However, 713 at a concentration selective for inhibition of AP-N (100 nM) potentiates the angiotensin IV-mediated increase of dopamine, suggesting that inhibition of AP-N lengthens the half-life of angiotensin IV. On the other hand, inhibition of both AP-N and IRAP by perfusion of 500 nM 7B completely abolishes the effect of angiotensin IV. We therefore hypothesize that the effect of angiotensin IV on dopamine release in the striatum is mediated via activation of IRAP and/or AP-N, possibly acting as receptors for angiotensin IV.

AB  - Motivation: Experimental limitations in high-throughput protein-protein interaction detection methods have resulted in low quality interaction datasets that contained sizable fractions of false positives and false negatives. Small-scale, focused experiments are then needed to complement the high-throughput methods to extract true protein interactions. However, the naturally vast interactomes would require much more scalable approaches. Results: We describe a novel method called IRAP(*) as a computational complement for repurification of the highly erroneous experimentally derived protein interactomes. Our method involves an iterative process of removing interactions that are confidently identified as false positives and adding interactions detected as false negatives into the interactomes. Identification of both false positives and false negatives are performed in IRAP(*) using interaction confidence measures based on network topological metrics. Potential false positives are identified amongst the detected interactions as those with very low computed confidence values, while potential false negatives are discovered as the undetected interactions with high computed confidence values. Our results from applying IRAP(*) on large-scale interaction datasets generated by the popular yeast-two-hybrid assays for yeast, fruit fly and worm showed that the computationally repurified interaction datasets contained potentially lower fractions of false positive and false negative errors based on functional homogeneity.

AB  - The anti-convulsant properties of angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and somatostatin-14, a substrate of IRAP, were evaluated in the acute pilocarpine rat seizure model. Simultaneously, the neurochemical changes in the hippocampus were monitored using in vivo microdialysis. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered Ang IV or somatostatin-14 caused a significant increase in the hippocampal extracellular dopamine and serotonin levels and protected rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures. These effects of Ang IV were both blocked by concomitant i.c.v. administration of the somatostatin receptor-2 antagonist cyanamid 154806. These results reveal a possible role for dopamine and serotonin in the anti-convulsant effect of Ang IV and somatostatin-14. Our study suggests that the ability of Ang IV to inhibit pilocarpine-induced convulsions is dependent on somatostatin receptor-2 activation, and is possibly mediated via the inhibition of IRAP resulting in an elevated concentration of somatostatin-14 in the brain.
