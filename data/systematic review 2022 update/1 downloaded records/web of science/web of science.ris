AB  - This research examined the reliability and validity of the Change Agenda Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (CA-IRAP). Change agendas that lead people to think that “reducing or removing undesirable thoughts and feelings will solve problems and lead to a more successful life” are considered unworkable in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). For acceptance-based interventions to succeed, relinquishing change agendas is important. However, currently available methods for measuring these types of change agendas are limited to explicit measures, which are vulnerable to distortion from social desirability and demand characteristics. The authors attempted to measure change agendas using the IRAP. A total of 131 undergraduate and graduate students (40 male, 91 female; mean age = 21.93,SD= 3.19) participated. First, we examined the CA-IRAP's discriminant validity in relation to explicit measures such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II in 83 participants who were able to pass the CA-IRAP. The correlations between the CA-IRAP and the explicit measures were low, confirming the discriminant validity of the CA-IRAP. Second, we examined the predictive validity of the CA-IRAP. Nineteen respondents had learned ACT and 34 respondents had never learned ACT. Non-ACT learners' CA-IRAP scores were higher than those of ACT learners, which confirmed the CA-IRAP's predictive validity. Finally, we examined the CA-IRAP's test-retest reliability, which was confirmed across some CA-IRAP trial types. In conclusion, the authors submit that the CA-IRAP has strong potential as a valid instrument for measuring the relative strength of relational responses around change agendas while controlling for variables such as demand characteristics.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY
AB  - Attractiveness bias is a robust finding in social domains, but the data is less clear regarding attractiveness bias in other domains including employability. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to investigate implicit attractiveness bias favouring employability for attractive versus unattractive facial image stimuli with a sample of university students (N=35; 25 Females). The IRAPs four trial-type methodology facilitated a nuanced analysis to determine if participant data showed pro-attractive bias, anti-attractive bias, some combination of both, or no evidence of any such bias. A pro-attractive bias was found in D-scores on three of the four IRAP trial-types. Results from an explicit Beliefs About Appearance Scale (BAAS; Spangler, 1999) showed high ratings for the importance of appearance for employability across both genders with no statistically significant gender impact. Findings extend extant research providing nuanced data about implicit attractiveness bias beyond social domains in the important area of employability.

AB  - The current study reports the findings of an experiment in which adolescents' explicit and implicit attitudes toward cyberbullying were explored. Participants first completed an explicit measure of their attitudes toward cyberbullying, followed by an implicit measure in the form of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results revealed that participants displayed a combination of anti- and pro-cyberbullying attitudes. There was no statistically significant correlation between participants' implicit and explicit attitudes toward cyberbullying. The current findings may have important implications for our understanding of adolescents' attitudes toward cyberbullying and the development of relevant educational programs.

AB  - The current study sought to investigate perspective-taking in a group of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The Psychosis Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (Psychosis-IRAP) contrasted statements and questions referring to `psychotic' and `non-psychotic' experiences. The IRAP and a Faux-pas (Theory of Mind) test were presented to two groups of participants: a clinical group with a diagnosis of psychosis and a control group. IRAP effects for each group were in the predicted direction and a ROC analysis showed that the IRAP correctly classified 80% of the individuals with psychosis with a sensitivity level of 84.2% and a specificity level of 27.8%. The IRAP was thus successfully used to correctly classify the population of clinical individuals. However, the study also demonstrated that the two groups were similar with regard to their level of competency on the perspective-taking IRAP. The article also discusses the relationship between the data and recent developments in RFT, in terms of relational flexibility.

AB  - Women are often subject to gender stereotyping in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to determine directionality of any implicit gender-STEM bias detected. In addition, the IRAP was used to explore the possibility of implicit ageism bias, because there is anecdotal evidence of high levels of ageism in the STEM areas. Thus two IRAPs (one with adult pictorial stimuli and one with child pictorial stimuli) were employed to assess implicit gender bias toward STEM with a sample of undergraduates (N= 33). Results indicated a gender STEM bias in both IRAPs and the directionality in both IRAPs was pro-male and not anti-female. Participant gender was not shown to impact results in either IRAP. Gender bias effects were more pronounced in the Adult-IRAP results. Comparison of bias toward older versus young pictorial stimuli was exploratory thus findings are preliminary but may suggest ageism and potential negative interaction effects between age and gender warrant further research.

AB  - Caregivers of people with dementia who endorse dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving are at high risk of experiencing higher levels of distress. These dysfunctional beliefs are presented in the form of rules, verbal statements that specify what responsibilities one should expect in order to be a “good caregiver,” and are characterized as rigid, unrealistic, or highly demanding. Previous studies relied exclusively on self-report measures when assessing such dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop and validate an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving (CARE-IRAP), and 2) considering the relatively high age of the sample, to analyze the adaptation of the IRAP for older adults, comparing the IRAP performance between older adult caregivers and middle-aged caregivers. Participants were 123 dementia family caregivers with a mean age of 62.24 +/- 12.89. Adaptations were made to the IRAP by adjusting the accuracy and response time criteria. The sample was split into middle-aged caregivers (below 60 years) and older adult caregivers (60 or older). The CARE-IRAP scores presented significant positive correlations with explicit measures of dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and experiential avoidance in caregiving. A similar pattern of results was observed across the two age groups. The results revealed that caregivers endorse implicit dysfunctional beliefs about caregiving and offer preliminary support for the use of the IRAP as a valid measure of implicit caregiving beliefs. This exploratory study is the first to adapt the IRAP criteria to older adults, and future studies should further explore criteria suitable for this population.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Empirical analysis of features of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure may be important to results. As such, the current research compared effects of response options that were contextually cued relational responses (C(rel)s) versus relational coherence indicators (RCIs) across two IRAPs conducted with college student participants (N = 40). The IRAPs were similar except for the response options used, which were either “Same”/”Opposite” (C-rels) versus “Accurate”/”Inaccurate” (RCIs). D-scores for both IRAPs showed the expected IRAP effect (bias). A critical difference was noted dependent upon the type of response options used: the IRAP effect was shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used. There was no statistically significant interaction effect shown between response option used and order of completion (i.e., C-rel IRAP first vs. RCI IRAP first), however, there was a statistically significant interaction effect shown between type of response options used on the IRAP, order of completion, and block-order presentation (consistent trial-blocks vs. inconsistent trial blocks presented first). Findings are discussed regarding potential implications and further research.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Self-compassion encompasses three factors: self-kindness, mindfulness, and common humanity. This study aimed to explore the factor of common humanity (the belief that suffering is a shared human experience) and whether people tend to identify with this factor more in relation to their own experiences or those of others. Previously, it has been suggested that when applying compassion, people tend to be harsher on themselves and more compassionate toward others. Most research in self-compassion has typically used explicit measures, which can be scientifically limiting. The present study employed an implicit measure, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to explore this domain. Participants (N = 55) completed the IRAP and its analog scale as well as Neff s self-compassion scale. Results showed that explicitly, participants reported high levels of common humanity and lack of isolation for both themselves as well as others. Implicitly, however, while they showed similar patterns in three of these four trial-types (i.e., common humanity regarding self and others and isolation with respect to others) they were neutral regarding self-isolation. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - A key aspect of self-forgiveness is that one needs to acknowledge one's failings and their consequences. The present study used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and an explicit IRAP analog measure to examine (1) responding to perceived failure following exposure to an insoluble task, and (2) the effect of a defusion intervention on responding in this context. Participants (n = 29) were first assessed for baseline performance on an IRAP and IRAP analog that assessed participants in terms of perceived relations between performance (success vs. failure) and feelings (positive vs. negative). They were then exposed to the insoluble task, after which they were asked to report on their performance and their feelings in relation to the task. They were subsequently assigned to hear either a defusion (n = 14) or control (n = 15) audio recording and were reexposed to the implicit and explicit measures. IRAP results showed significant denial of failure as leading to positive feelings for both groups following the insoluble task, whereas the explicit (IRAP analog) measure failed to show any comparable effect of this task. As regards the defusion intervention, no effect was seen at the implicit level whereas effects at the explicit level were ambiguous. Results and future directions are discussed.

The relationship between six TBC items and the “Good Teacher” stimulus was assessed using the IRAP, and the correlation between the score of participants in an undergraduate course and the teacher's assessment was assessed. Forty university students participated, who answered both instruments and reported the grade received in the discipline. The D-IRAP scores' averages were statistically significant for “good teacher-positive-true” and “bad teacher-negative-true”. The correlation indexes between the participants' grades in the discipline and the way they evaluated the teacher were not statistically significant.

AB  - Attractiveness bias has been well-documented in social domains, however, an investigation into the attractiveness-bias effect on employability has not been conducted using implicit measures. In Study 1 (N= 24) the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and a number of explicit measures (e.g., self-report questionnaires) were used to investigate the attractiveness-bias effect on employability using stimuli of high and low attractiveness. Results from Study 1 indicated that there was a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable on explicit and implicit measures. In Study 2, (N= 52) these measures were used to investigate the attractiveness-bias effect on employability using stimuli of high and medium attractiveness. Results from Study 2 indicated that there was a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable on explicit measures and a significant bias in the direction of attractive-employable and medium-attractive-unemployable on implicit measures. There was no effect of participant gender onD-scores for either study. Findings are discussed in relation to previous research and implications for the use of implicit measurement to measure attractiveness bias in the domain of employability.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This experimental study explored the use of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) for understanding the vertical spatial metaphor of power. In the classic IRAP procedure, we formed four sets of stimuli based on the relationship between power words (powerful and powerless words) and vertical position on a computer screen (upper or lower) that were either pro-metaphor (i.e., powerful-high, powerless-low) or anti-metaphor (i.e., powerful-low, powerless-high). Participants were then asked to judge whether the words were consistent or inconsistent with the set of instructions given to them. We found that the Dirap scores of powerful words in an above vertical space and powerless words in a below vertical space were higher than zero. Furthermore, the D-irap scores of the pro-metaphor stimuli were significantly greater than were those of the anti-metaphor stimuli. Vertical spatial position metaphor of power concepts was verified again by D-irap. These findings suggest that there is an established spatial metaphor for power, which we explain using relational frame theory. It is the first study to our knowledge to explore this metaphor using the IRAP, which overcomes the limitations of paradigms such as the implicit association test, and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of the metaphor.

AB  - The current study aimed to investigate whether the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) can be a suitable measure of hopelessness in elderly people. At the moment, studies involving implicit attitude assessments in this population are scarce and this study sought to contribute to the literature in this field. Thirty-seven participants (average age = 65) with normal cognitive functioning completed the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and an IRAP designed to measure hopelessness. Results revealed significant correlations between BHS and IRAP scores. In addition, performance in two IRAP trial types predicted BHS clusters on high and low hopelessness. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first article describing an attempt to apply the IRAP as a procedure for psychological assessment of elderly people. The results suggest that further research for procedural refinement is needed and the potential application of the IRAP as a complement to self-report instruments for the diagnosis of hopelessness and depression.

T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB  - Experiment 1 of the current research attempted to establish fear and avoidance functions for arbitrary stimuli via combinatorial entailment using training and testing versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The critical tests for the transformation of functions involved exposure to two separate Test-IRAPs (one for fear and one for avoidance), but both failed to yield any evidence for the transformation of functions. The findings of Experiment 1 contrast with the clear evidence of a transformation of functions via mutually entailed relations that was reported by Leech et al. (2018), thus suggesting a potential boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and testing context (i.e., derived transformation occurs for mutual but not combinatorial entailing). In Experiment 2, we sought to manipulate two of the dimensions of the multi-dimensional multi-level (MDML) framework to determine if they would alter the apparent boundary condition suggested by the results of Experiment 1. Results indicate that levels of derivation and an opportunity to respond to the derived relations play an important role in the transformation of fear and avoidance functions via combinatorial entailment within the IRAP context.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
AB  - Plain English summary Body dissatisfaction can be thought of as the discrepancy between actual and desired body size. This is typically measured with rating scales depicting a series of body silhouettes of increasing size, from extreme thinness to fatness. Respondents mark the points that match their current body size and the one they would ideally like to be (the more distance between both, the more body dissatisfaction). Like all self-reports, these scales are liable to self-presentation biases. Experimental procedures that require respondents to answer under time pressure (implicit measures) tap into more automatic reactions that are less amenable to deliberate manipulation. This study used one such procedure (the IRAP) to examine how rapidly participants identified themselves (or not) with pictures of underweight or overweight, and how rapidly they expressed a desire to be (or not) like such pictures. Participants did not show a clear discrepancy between their actual and their ideal body size with the IRAP. However, automatic reactions indicative of acceptance/rejection of the idea of becoming fatter, predicted the degree of body image distress as measured with different instruments. Unwillingness to accept this idea was associated with more severe symptoms of disordered eating. Background The discrepancy between actual and ideal body image is considered an index of body dissatisfaction and a risk factor for eating disorders. While discrepancy has been traditionally tested with figural drawing rating scales, in recent times the use of implicit measures has been explored. Methods This study employs the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to examine actual-ideal body-size discrepancy in a sample of 130 Spanish college students, as well as its utility to predict symptoms of eating disorders and other body-image relevant measures. Participants completed the Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS). The three smallest and the three largest contour drawings of the CDRS were used as target stimuli in two different IRAP tasks: one in combination with the sample phrases “I am” and “I am not” (that assessed implicit actual body image), another in combination with the phrases “I want to be” and “I don't want to be” (that assessed implicit ideal body image). After completing both IRAP tasks, participants completed explicit measures of body-image psychological inflexibility, body dissatisfaction, and symptoms of eating disorders. Results Results showed a small implicit bias towards thinness. Participants were faster in affirming than denying that they are thin and that they desire to be thin. They were also faster in affirming than denying that they are fat and that they want to be fat, but to a smaller extent than with thinness. Specifically, the implicit desire to be (or not be) fat emerged as an independent predictor of eating disorder symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and body dissatisfaction that significantly increased the predictive power of CDRS scores. Conclusions These findings underscore the need for further research on specific body image implicit beliefs towards fatness, both in subclinical and clinical populations, in order to examine whether willingness to accept the idea that one can have a larger body size can be a suitable target for prevention and intervention in eating disorders.

AB  - The present study sought to measure potential implicit biases regarding modest and revealing clothing worn by college-age females reporting sexual harassment in terms of the believability of the claim using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. In addition, participants' responding in public and private experimental conditions was compared. Results were analyzed to determine if implicit biases regarding the believability of sexual harassment complainants related to their clothing were observed. No significant difference was found between the private and public contexts, F(1, 46) = 0.7780, p = 0.3824. A significant bias in favor of women dressed in modest clothing was observed in the overall scores for the public context, t(23) = 5.272, p < 0.0001; additional analyses for individual trial types are included. These results may suggest that, although participants did not demonstrate significant bias against women dressed in revealing clothes, a bias in favor of women dressed modestly was present. This study produced preliminary data that may be indicative of an increased likelihood of a claim of sexual harassment/assault being observed as “believable” when the claimant's clothes are of a more modest fashion.

AB  - Objective: Psychodynamic and cognitive theories postulate a prominent role of aggressiveness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Explicit assessment of aggressiveness in OCD has yielded diverging results. The present study aimed to investigate aggressiveness in OCD using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Method: Patients with OCD (n = 59) were compared to non-clinical controls (NCs; n = 31) on an IRAP using self-referential statements and the explicit State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II (STAXI-II). During the computerbased IRAP, participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately (”correct” or “incorrect”) to the relation of two presented stimuli (e.g., “I am” + “aggressive”). Results: D-IRAP-Scores for the I am aggressive trial type were significantly higher in NCs compared to the OCD sample (d = 0.73). Patients with OCD scored significantly higher on the Trait Anger scales and the Anger Expression-Out scale of the STAXI-II. The I am aggressive D; RA p-Score correlated with the overall Trait Anger scale (r = -.33, p = .001) and with the Anger Expression-In scale (r = -0.31, p = .003). Conclusions: Patients with OCD were more ambivalent about their own aggressiveness than NCs. These findings were in line with patients' explicit aggressiveness.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Recent research has indicated that the results of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) may be affected by certain facets of the measure. The current research explores the use of response options in the IRAP and their potential influence on the responding of college students (N = 40) across two similar IRAPs. The IRAPs differed solely in the different types of response option used: contextually cued relational responses (C-rels) or relational coherence indicators (RCIs). The terms “same”/”opposite” served as C-rel response options whereas the RCI response options were “right”/”wrong.” The expected IRAP effect was evident on D-scores from both IRAPs. This effect was shown to be stronger when C-rel response options were used (Wilk's Lambda = .86, F (1, 36) = 6.05, p = .02, eta(2)(p) = .14.), however, there was no statistically significant effect shown for the order of their presentation, nor were any other interaction effects detected. Potential implications and possible avenues for future research are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The current study aimed to explore the relationship between implicit and explicit gender bias in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, and selection behavior among seventy STEM students. The selection behavior focused on gendered beliefs about STEM ability by assessing via a selection task how often participants chose a male or a female as the better performer on a number of STEM-related tasks. Participants then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and rating scales to assess implicit and explicit bias respectively. Men and women STEM students exhibited a statistically significant, large implicit pro-Men-STEM bias while women also demonstrated a significant pro-Women-STEM bias. Explicitly, both groups demonstrated a Male-STEM/Female-Arts bias. While selection task scores were not significantly biased, they did correlate with implicit scores on the Men-STEM IRAP trial-type. The results highlighted the subtle nuances that can be revealed by assessing both implicit and explicit gender-STEM biases, particularly when utilizing a measure such as the IRAP. Limitations and future research directions are addressed.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY
AB  - The research literature remains unclear as to whether discrimination of bullying improves with age, thus the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to investigate if college students compared to post-primary students showed increased discrimination of phrases with bullying potential. Participants (N= 60; n= 30 post-primary and n= 30 university students) completed the IRAP in which trial-blocks alternately affirmed or denied innocuous v. toxic phrases as harmless or abusive. Shorter response latencies for particular trial-blocks meant participants responded more rapidly, thus indicating preference. Pre- and post-IRAPs were also conducted to determine if an intervention (government educational videos) increased participants' implicit preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, or decreased preference for toxic phrases. IRAP data showed a statistically significant implicit preference for innocuous phrases as harmless, for both post-primary and university students, with no statistically significant difference between these groups. There was no difference in IRAP results pre and post a brief educational intervention, thus the research did not support the intervention. Analysis of participants' explicit data (self-report questionnaires) indicated no age differences for prosocial behaviour or attitudes towards victims. Thus, age was not shown to improve discrimination of bullying in the current research.

AB  - In exploring the extent to which the Implicit Relational Assessment procedure (IRAP) may function as a measure of the derived transformation of functions, it is important to determine if it is also sensitive to particular moderating variables. This was the purpose of the current study, which focused on manipulating three different motivating conditions related to stimuli presented during the IRAP task. First, two equivalence classes were established: A1-B1-C1-D1 and A2-B2-C2-D2. These classes comprised nonsense forms (B, C, and D) and two meaningful stimuli: a picture of a glass full of water (A1) and a neutral picture (A2). Derived transformation of function from the meaningful stimuli to two nonsense forms (D1 and D2) was then assessed by means of a semantic differential and an IRAP. Before assessment, participants were divided in three groups: the first had water intake; the second had pepper; the third had pepper before the semantic differential, followed by an extra dose before the IRAP testing blocks. Results suggest that the motivative conditions progressively affected both measures. Regarding the semantic differential, D1 (water) and D2 (neutral) stimuli were close to neutrality for the Water group; for the Pepper and Double Pepper groups, however, the D1 (water) stimulus had a positive valence whereas D2 (neutral) was neutral. In the IRAP, both the Water and Pepper group evaluated D1 as positive; nonetheless, for the Double Pepper group, IRAP scores revealed that D1 was even more positive compared to the other groups. Implications for the IRAP are discussed in terms of the DAARRE model.

AB  - Experiment 1 aimed to establish “fearful” and “pleasant” functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar' Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Cognitive perspective-taking research has primarily been conducted under the rubric of theory of mind (ToM), with the core skill believed to involve the correct attribution of mental states to oneself and others as a means of explaining and predicting behavior. Relational frame theory (RFT) has provided a behavioral account of performances on true and false belief protocols by appealing to the three perspective-taking (deictic) relations. The current research sought to investigate the relative strength of cognitive perspective-taking abilities within the context of a false belief vignette and related IRAP. Experiment 1 investigated the impact of block order presentation and vignette stimuli order on IRAP performances. That is, across four conditions, rule order presentations (i.e., vignette consistent vs. vignette inconsistent) and vignette stimuli presentation were manipulated. Results indicated that vignette consistent responding was observed to varying degrees across conditions. To decrease this variability across conditions, Experiment 2 presented a vignette before each block of trials but again the IRAP showed only limited sensitivity to the vignette. The current findings and considerations for future research are discussed in terms of a recently published conceptual analysis of false belief by Kavanagh et al. (2020).

AB  - The Teacher Behavior Checklist (TBC) consists of 28 items mainly used to measure college teachers' performance or to investigate the primary qualities of good teachers. Psychometric studies using the TBC have presented evidence of its validity and reliability in different cultures. However, TBC content validity is exclusively based on self-reported measurements, which presents limitations that are widely discussed in the literature. Our study sought to investigate an alternative measurement for TBC content validity using a latency-based task, namely the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). The main objective was to assess the strength of the relationship between the concept of Good Teacher and Bad Teacher and six positive and negative features derived from TBC items using an IRAP preparation. The second objective was to investigate the correlation between IRAP and TBC scores. The participants were 64 undergraduate students (M = 21; F = 43), aged 16 to 36. The IRAP trials included six target stimuli selected from the TBC that could be either Good Teacher or Bad Teacher, and six labels that could be either positive or negative features. The IRAP revealed that the Good Teacher is Positive, not Negative. On the other hand, the Bad Teacher is Negative, but participants could not deny that this teacher has Positive features. Only one statistically significant correlation was found between the Good Teacher-Negative IRAP trial type and the TBC score. Future studies should expand the use of implicit measurements in psychometric studies using the TBC.

AB  - The IRAP (Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure) is a procedure developed for the assessment of beliefs, attitudes, and other implicit cognitive elements. Stimuli-related variables that influence IRAP performance have been studied, but not the influence of social situation variables of the test itself. Gender stereotypes are one of the implicit beliefs most studied with the IRAP. Gender bias relational responses may be brought under the functional control of situational social variables, such as responding in a mixed gender group or responding in a single gender group (women only/men only). One hundred and ten undergraduates (65 women and 45 men; aged 18-22) performed a collective IRAP application about gender stereotypes. In the first experimental condition, the test was applied in mixed gender groups. In the second experimental condition, the test was applied in single gender groups. The results showed that gender stereotypes were present in men's and women's responses to the IRAP. Both male and female participants showed greater gender bias when responding in single gender groups than in mixed gender groups in all the IRAP trial types. The social context in which IRAP was applied influenced the participant's performance. The advantages of collective IRAP applications are also discussed.

AB  - In this study, white participants were exposed to a single-label or multiple-label racial bias IRAP before and after a faking instruction (i.e., two exposures to the IRAP). The faking instruction involved asking all participants to imagine that they were a black person when completing the second IRAP. The results indicated that participants produced evidence of pro-white and anti-black biases both before and after receiving the faking instruction. Analyses of variance revealed no main or interaction effects for the single-versus multiple-label variable, and trial-type specific paired t-tests yielded no significant differences between the pre- and post-faking instruction IRAPs. The results were consistent with previous racial bias findings using the IRAP and supported the conclusion that faking only occurs when participants are provided with specific information about the task parameters. Implications for faking research, and the impact of instructions generally, on the IRAP are discussed.

AB  - Teachers' attitudes towards common disorders such as ADHD and anxiety are important to investigate, given that teachers play a significant role in the lives of young children. Implicit attitudes have not previously been investigated in this area. The current research aimed to explore teachers' implicit and explicit gender-biased attitudes towards children with ADHD and anxiety. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used to measure implicit bias, and results were analyzed in relation to explicit measures. Results indicated that teachers (N = 38) showed implicit and explicit gender biases, however there were no significant relationships between the implicit and explicit measures. The research adds to the small pool of existing literature on the topic and has potential implications regarding teachers' understanding of ADHD and anxiety.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been successfully used to analyze the strength of symbolic relations. Taking advantage of this, Bortoloti, de Almeida, de Almeida, and de Rose (Frontiers in Psychology, 10(954),2019) reported a higher relational strength in equivalence classes containing happy faces than in those containing negative faces. This so-calledhappiness superiority effect(HSE) was inferred from an IRAP that included stimuli presented during the equivalence training. Such HSE apparently had a stronger influence on IRAP performance than the equivalence training itself. In this article, we comment on these data and present a new analysis that supports a hypothesis raised by Bortoloti et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 10(954),2019) to account for a surprising IRAP performance in their experiment. Based on this, we discuss new avenues for the investigation of properties of relational responding using the IRAP.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used to assess the probability of arbitrarily applicable relational responding or as an indirect measure of implicit attitudes. To date, IRAP effects have commonly been quantified using the DIRAP scoring algorithm, which was derived from Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji's (2003) D effect size measure. In the article, we highlight the difference between an effect size measure and a scoring algorithm, discuss the drawbacks associated with D, and propose an alternative: a probabilistic, semi-parametric measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement, & Ottoy, 2012). Using a relatively large IRAP dataset, we demonstrate how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which are typical of reaction time data). Finally, we conclude that PI models, in addition to producing point estimate scores, can also provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and afford the possibility to include covariates, all of which may aid single subject design studies.

T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON BEHAVIOR SCIENCE
AB  - The implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) was initially developed as a way to assess the strength and probability of natural verbal relations, as defined within relational frame theory (RFT), and was conceptually rooted within the behavior-analytic tradition. However, the IRAP quickly became employed primarily as a measure of implicit cognition, more in line with mainstream psychology than behavior analysis. In doing so, research using the IRAP increasingly employed ill-defined mainstream psychological terms, focused on correlational analyses with traditional psychometry, and thus emphasized prediction over the prediction-and-influence of behavior. Although perhaps beneficial to the study of implicit cognition, this approach could be argued to have limited the IRAP's utility in behavior analyses of human language and cognition. In the current article we will reflect on this suggestion, on the IRAPs place and current use in the field of behavior analysis, and on its potential future within behavioral psychology in light of recent conceptual and empirical advances in RFT. In doing so, it is hoped that the measure may be refined into a better understood, more precise, functional-analytic tool.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been typically used to access behavioral biases to relations that the participants learned throughout their history of social interactions. Recent research has highlighted the role of the stimulus orienting function on IRAP performance. The present study used the IRAP to assess preference biases for smartphone application (app) icons, namely WhatsApp and Messenger, and intended to check if these biases correspond to the orienting function of these stimuli in a visual search paradigm monitored by eye tracking. The IRAP presented relations between the WhatsApp and Messenger icons and happy or angry facial expressions. The visual search task had two steps: in Step 1, matrices of app icons were designed to emulate smartphone screens, and the participant was instructed to find either the WhatsApp or the Messenger icon; in Step 2, happy or angry faces were presented as targets in matrices of pictures of neutral faces that functioned as distractors. Participants were more prompted to respond Yes than No to the relation between the WhatsApp icon and happy facial expressions in IRAP trials, and showed ambivalent bias to the Messenger icon. Regarding the visual search performance, participants' were faster to find the WhatsApp target than to find the Messenger target. In addition, they were faster to find the happy targets than the angry targets. Results from the current study corroborate the hypothesis that the stimulus orienting function may play an important role on IRAP performance and, as a result, are supportive to the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc explanation provided in a previously published article, the first experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved in producing IRAP effects-the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model-which is presented in the General Discussion.

AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) assesses the relative strength of derived relational responding. A growing body of IRAP research has focused on assessing verbal relations pertaining to the self and others. This preliminary study sought to determine the feasibility of using matched pictures of self and of others across two IRAPs (N=32). Both the self- and other-IRAPs also presented pictures of pens as the contrast category. The results of the IRAPs were broadly consistent with common-sense expectations. That is, participants confirmed more readily than they denied that a picture of a face was a face and that a picture of a pen was a pen. They also denied more readily than confirmed that a picture of a pen was a face and that a picture of a face was a pen. No significant differences in the sizes of the individual trial type effects, or differences among those effects, emerged between the two (self and other) IRAPs. However, two key differential trial type effects did emerge for both IRAPs, which relate directly to recent and on-going conceptual developments surrounding the IRAP and the analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding in general. These developments are considered and discussed in detail toward the end of the article.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Under the rubric of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), researchers have investigated the role of deictic relational responding in the analysis of self in relation to others, place, and time, primarily through the use of an extended developmental protocol (Barnes-Holmes, 2001). In a move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological Record, 66, 243-252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to self was involved, only responding to others. The results from Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the read-aloud procedure.

AB  - This study extended previous research on the effect of education and communication on anti-autism bias and stigmatization, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as an assessment tool and employing undergraduates as participants. Experiment 1 examined the effect of a simple video and text-based educational intervention on attitudes towards autism, as assessed both using the IRAP and various explicit measures. Participants received either an educational video-text combination or a control video-text combination before exposure to the assessments. Findings showed positive responding towards both normally developing and autism spectrum individuals across both conditions on both the IRAP and the explicit measures. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of two different types of online video-based narrative regarding autism, one negatively oriented and the other positively oriented, on both implicit and explicit responding. Findings suggested that the negative video affected both implicit and explicit responding, albeit in different ways. Responding on the IRAP showed a stronger pro-normally developing bias whereas explicit responding showed a stronger anti-autism bias. Implications and possible future directions are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The current study investigated the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding involving emotional pictographs (emojis) used in electronic messages by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). College students (N = 41) were trained to establish two classes of equivalent stimuli, each comprising a happy or an angry emoji, and three pseudo-words that presumably became symbols of the emotional pictographs. In a subsequent IRAP test, combinations of symbols (labels) and emojis (targets) generated four trial-types (with the consistent response within parentheses): happy symbol-happy emoji (true); happy symbol-negative emoji (false) negative symbol-happy emoji (false); and negative symbol-negative emoji (true), referred to as trial types 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A positive score occurred only for trial-type 1 [happy symbol-happy emoji (true)]. Scores for trial-types 2 and 4 were close to zero, and the score for trial-type 3 [negative symbol-happy emoji (false)] was negative. This negative D-IRAP score means that participants were faster to respond true than false for the combination of negative symbol and happy emoji. These results are discussed in terms of the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model. It is hypothesized that the orienting and evoking (functional) properties of the positive target stimulus (happy emoji) and the positive response option (true) had a stronger bearing on participants' responding in trial type 3 than the relation between the label and target stimuli presented in this trial. We argue that the current study provides an empirical demonstration of a dissonant target trial type effect (DTTTE) that appeared to counter equivalence relations trained within the experimental session and discuss implications for IRAP research.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR
AB  - Rule-governed behavior and derived stimulus relations have always shared strong conceptual links within behavior analysis. However, experimental analysis linking the two domains remains limited. The current study consisted of three experiments that aimed to continue to bridge this experimental gap. The first experiment sought to establish the extent to which a training version of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) could be used to establish and successfully reverse experimentally established derived relations. The results suggested that the Training IRAP could successfully produce derived reversals. Experiments 2 and 3 explored the extent to which reversed derived relations would control rule-governed behavior when the contingencies for rule-following competed with the rule. In Experiment 2, the task contingencies were immediately in opposition to the (reversed) derived rule, and participants generally responded in accordance with the task contingencies, rather than the rule. In Experiment 3, the task contingencies were initially rule-consistent before a contingency reversal that later made them rule-inconsistent. Here evidence of rule-persistence emerged. The results of the research are considered within the context of a recent framework that has emerged out of RFT for analyzing the dynamics involved in derived relational responding.

AB  - Medical students are at a disproportionate risk for experiencing burnout, making management of burnout a critical skill to teach in medical education. If left unmanaged, students may develop maladaptive coping strategies as well as substance misuse, suicidal ideation, and poorer quality patient care. This study examined the impact of Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) as a burnout management curriculum with medical students at a western U.S. medical school. Participants (n = 281) completed measures pertaining to psychological flexibility (i.e., the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II; AAQ-II) and burnout (i.e., the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; IRAP). Assessments were collected at three time points over the first two years of medical school. ACT was provided between Time 1 and 2, and not between Time 2 and 3. Results demonstrated statistically significant improvements, specifically for students starting medical school with clinically relevant levels of distress on the AAQ-II (n = 53). Positivity bias and negativity bias were measured with a burnout themed Modified-IRAP (MD-IRAP). Positivity bias maintained across all three time points, despite an increase in negativity bias. Implications for teaching psychological flexibility as a burnout management tool in higher education and healthcare systems will be discussed.

T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
AB  - Research on self-determination theory has typically relied on explicit measures when examining the concept of competence need satisfaction. As a result, we know relatively little about competence need satisfaction that arises under conditions of automaticity. Across four studies, we developed and validated implicit measures of competence need satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together, these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence. Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is needed, together with research on possible explanations for the low reliability of the IRAP.

AB  - The feasibility of implicitly assessing medical student burnout was explored, using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), to measure longitudinal student burnout over the first two years of medical school and directly comparing it with an existing explicit measure of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory; MBI). Three successive cohorts of medical students completed both implicit and explicit measures of burnout at several time points during their first two years of medical school. Both assessments were conducted via the internet within a one-week period during the first week of medical school, the end of the first year of medical school, and the end of the second year, though not all cohorts were able to complete the assessments at all time points. Mixed linear models were used to compare the two measures directly, as well as to evaluate changes over time in each measure separately. Minimal correspondence was observed between the implicit and explicit measures of burnout on a within-subject basis. However, when analyzed separately, all subscales of both measures detected significant change over time in the direction of greater levels of burnout, particularly during the first year of medical school. These results provide preliminary evidence the IRAP is able to assess implicit attitudes related to burnout among medical students, though additional research is needed. The IRAP detected consistent improvements in positive implicit attitudes toward medical training during students' second year of medical school, which was not detected by the MBI. Possible implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The mapping relationship between social status and horizontal space (left/right) in Chinese culture has a long history. In order to explore the representation pattern of horizontal spatial metaphor of social status in Chinese culture, this study introduced two direct measurements, implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) paradigm, and spatial placement task to evaluate the mapping of social status to horizontal space. A total of 144 Chinese undergraduates participated in the research, wherein they were asked to place certain words indicating social status in either left or right box before or after the IRAP computer test. The results from the two measurements consistently showed that the mode of HIGH SOCIAL STATUS-LEFT and LOW SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT (HLLR) had an advantage over HIGH SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT and LOW SOCIAL STATUS-LEFT (HRLL), implying that the representation pattern of horizontal spatial metaphor of social status for the Chinese is HIGH SOCIAL STATUS-LEFT and LOW SOCIAL STATUS-RIGHT. However, the result convergence of the two measurements was not high, which suggests that embodiment effect has multiple characteristics and new specific experimental paradigms should be created to measure it.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - The research investigated the contextual effects of mood on implicit measures of `wanting more' as a proxy of materialism and investigated the basic verbal processes underpinning this behaviour. Sixty university students were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to either a positive (n = 21), negative (n = 20) or neutral (n= 19) mood induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS), materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP, shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad) compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were interpreted as an implicit bias towards `wanting more'. Compared to the neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition demonstrated an increased bias towards `wanting less' (p = .028). Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with an implicit bias towards `wanting more' (r(s)'s ranging from - .455 to -. 565, p's ranging from .01 to .038), while reduced levels of materialism were significantly correlated with an implicit bias towards wanting less (r(s) = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary support for the IRAP as a generalised implicit measure of `wanting more' as a proxy of materialism; and suggest that changes in mood may influence this effect. Findings are discussed from a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) perspective.

AB  - Previous research on mock-jury trials has shown an explicit attractiveness bias in participant attributes of innocence. This study used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure attractiveness-bias in implicit evaluations of innocence or guilt with a sample of 46 college students. Alternate IRAP trial-blocks required participants to affirm relations consistent and inconsistent with attractiveness bias (attractive-innocent/unattractive guilty versus unattractive-innocent/ attractiveguilty). Faster responding across consistent trial-blocks was interpreted in terms of implicit stereotype. Participants' beliefs about the importance of their own appearances were examined using the Beliefs about Appearances Scale (BAAS) and explicit attractiveness ratings for the IRAP photographic stimuli were measured using Likert scales; analysis examined relationships between these beliefs and IRAP scores. Results revealed statistically signifi cant attractiveness bias for both male and female participants; specifically, both a pro-attractiveness and anti-unattractive bias. Findings are discussed regarding research in implicit evaluations of innocence or guilt and effects of attractiveness bias. Keywords: IRAP, attractiveness bias, beauty bias, guilt or innocence.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Research on implicit attitudes to body image has grown substantially in recent years. The extant evidence reveals an implicit weight bias in the general population that has generally been interpreted in terms of anti-fat attitudes. However, research with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) shows that this bias appears to be driven by pro-slim rather than anti-fat implicit attitudes. Besides, the only IRAP study of this sort conducted in Spain found no evidence of such implicit weight bias (with similarly positive attitudes to thinness and fatness). Given the existing differences in body dissatisfaction (BD) among diverse cultural contexts, we predicted that discrepancies in findings about implicit weight bias might be related to differences in BD amongst the samples in the different studies. This study explores whether women with extreme scores in BD (High vs. Low) show different patterns of attitudes to female body shape. Spanish female college students with extreme scores in the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ: high >= 104, percentile 80; low <= 52, percentile 20) completed an IRAP with pictures of overweight and underweight women as target stimuli and the words pleasant and unpleasant as labels. Participants also completed explicit ratings to the same stimuli and clinically relevant measures of body image related distress. Results showed an implicit weight bias only for women high in BD. While both groups showed equally positive implicit attitudes to thinness, only women with low BD showed implicit positive attitudes to fatness (and hence no bias). In turn, both groups presented a clear pro-thin/anti-fat explicit bias with positive ratings for underweight pictures and negative ratings for overweight pictures. The latter were stronger for the high BD group. Therefore, between-group differences were mainly driven by differences in attitudes to fatness (both implicit and explicit). Both implicit and explicit attitudes to fatness independently predicted eating disorders symptoms and other clinically relevant measures. These results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications.

AB  - Studies on equivalence relations have suggested that abstract symbols might acquire emotional functions when related to facial expressions. The present study aimed to investigate the transformation of emotional functions from facial expressions of fear and of happiness to abstract stimuli via equivalence relations. A delayed matching-to-sample task established two equivalence classes between facial expressions of emotions and nonsense abstract stimuli: A1(Fear)-B1-C1-D1; A2(Happiness)-B2-C2-D2. After relational training (AB, AC, CD) and equivalence tests (BD, DB), the participants evaluated the meaning of one nonsense stimulus from each class (D1 and D2) by means of a semantic differential and an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Results from both the semantic differential and the IRAP supported the conclusion that the emotional functions of the faces, in terms of fear and happiness, had transformed via the equivalence classes to the D stimuli. Results are discussed in terms of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The stimulus equivalence paradigm presented operational criteria to identify symbolic functions in observable behaviors. When humans match dissimilar stimuli (e.g., words to pictures), equivalence relations between those stimuli are likely to be demonstrated through behavioral tests derived from the logical properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. If these properties are confirmed, one can say that those stimuli are members of an equivalence class in which each member is substitutable for the others. A number of studies, which have established equivalence classes comprised of arbitrary stimuli and pictures of faces expressing emotions, have found that valences of the faces affect the relatedness of equivalent stimuli. Importantly, several studies reported stronger relational strength in equivalence classes containing happy faces than in equivalence classes containing angry faces. The processes that may account for this higher degree of relatability of happy faces are not yet known. The current study investigated the dynamics of the symbolic relational responding involving facial expressions of different emotions by means of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). Participants were 186 undergraduate students who were taught to establish two equivalence classes, each comprising pictures of faces expressing either happiness (for one class) or a negative emotion (for another class), and meaningless words. The IRAP effect was taken as an index for the relational strength established between equivalent stimuli in the different equivalence classes. The dynamics of arbitrary relational responding in the course of the four IRAP trial types revealed that the participants exhibited a stronger IRAP effect in trials involving the happy faces and a weaker IRAP effect in trials involving the negative faces. These findings indicate that the happy faces had higher impact on the symbolic relational responding than the negative faces. The potential role played by the orienting function of happy vs. negative faces is discussed. By considering other studies that also reported a happiness superiority effect in other contexts, we present converging evidence for the prioritization of positive affect in emotional, categorical, and symbolic processing.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is an assessment tool designed to measure one's learning history with respect to preexisting verbal relations (Barnes-Holmes, Hayden, Barnes-Holmes, & Stewart,2008). Responses to stimuli are regarded as implicit because they are measured with respect to the associated response latencies and accuracy, or brief and immediate relational responding (BIRRs; Hughes & Barnes-Holmes,2013, p. 104). This study used the modified (MD) IRAP to select stimuli that were presented in motivational statements in a simulated work task to increase cooperative and conformity responding. Participants came into contact with customized motivational statements promoting cooperative and conformity responding in conditions with a competing pay-for-performance contingency using an alternating treatments design. Results showed that motivational statements temporarily increased cooperative and conformity responding. Moreover, those participants identified as having a stronger history with particular stimuli, as identified in the MD IRAP, chose to cooperate and conform at higher and more sustained rates. The coherence between implicit responding, as demonstrated in the MD IRAP, and explicit responding, as demonstrated in the simulated work task, and the implications it has on prosocial behaviors will be discussed.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - A recently published article reported a particular pattern of responding that has been observed on the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), referred to as a Single-Trial-Type-Dominance-Effect (STTDE; Finn, Barnes-Holmes, & McEnteggart in The Psychological Record, 68(1), 11-25, 2018). To account for the phenomenon, the Differential Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding Effects (DAARRE) model of IRAP performance was proposed. The DAARRE model predicts the STTDE in terms of an overlap in the functional properties of the label, target, and response-option stimuli presented within an IRAP. This article presents an initial attempt at engineering a STTDE within an experimental session. Forty participants were exposed to a series of training procedures and IRAPs. The training procedures consisted of a series of trials that aimed to establish a “True” function for a picture stimulus that was subsequently presented in the IRAP; participants were then exposed to an IRAP in which participants were required to respond “True” on a specific trial-type that presented that picture. Consistent with the DAARRE model, the STTDE emerged for the predicted trial-type, with analyses at both the group and individual participant level supporting this conclusion. The implications of the findings for future research on analyzing the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding are discussed.

AB  - Two studies are presented that involved exploring four different versions of the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to target self-relevant stimulus relations. Experiment 1 employed stimuli from previous research that used the IRAP to target stimulus relations pertaining to self, and self-esteem in particular. Experiment 2 aimed to explore the use of different types of stimuli (i.e., pictures as well as words), that again focused on self-related stimulus relations, and their potential correlations with measures of self-esteem and psychological distress. Experiment 1 yielded broadly similar findings to those reported previously. Experiment 2 showed that only one trial type from the IRAP using pictures depicting success versus failure correlated with the measures of self-esteem and psychological distress; none of the remaining 11 trial types across the three IRAPs yielded any significant correlations. The current findings may be seen as relatively progressive when presented in the context of a theoretical model that may be used, albeit in a post-hoc manner, to interpret the specific IRAP response patterns obtained in the current and previously published research. In particular, an in-depth RFT conceptual analysis of the findings using a recently proposed model of IRAP effects is presented.

AB  - The research used an alternating-treatments design to compare relational responding for five children with diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in two teaching conditions. Both conditions used applied behavior analysis; one was usual tabletop teaching (TT), and one was an interactive computerized teaching program, the Teacher-Implicit Relational Assessment Programme (T-IRAP; Kilroe, Murphy, Barnes-Holmes, & Barnes-Holmes, Behavioral Development Bulletin, 19(2), 60-80, 2014). Relational skills targeted were coordination (same/different), with nonarbitrary and arbitrary stimuli. Participants' relational learning outcomes were compared in terms of speed of responding and accuracy (percentage correct) in T-IRAP and TT conditions. Results showed significantly increased speed for all five participants during T-IRAP teaching across all procedures; however, accuracy was only marginally increased during T-IRAP. Pre- and posttraining comparison of participant scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (Dunn & Dunn, 2007), and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990) was conducted. An improvement in raw scores on both measures was evident for one participant who learned complex arbitrary relations; no changes were shown for participants who learned only basic nonarbitrary relations.

AB  - Under a Relational Frame Theory (RFT) framework, researchers have investigated the role of deictic relational responding (perspective-taking) in the analysis of self in relation to others, place, and time. The aim of the current research was to develop IRAPs that targeted deictic relational responding with regard to the mental states of self and others. This was pursued in a series of experiments that employed a novel version of the IRAP, known as the Natural Language-IRAP (NL-IRAP). The use of the NL-IRAP allowed for the presentation of relatively complex statements that required participants to infer the thoughts or beliefs of others on a trial-by-trial basis within the IRAP. Across a sequence of six experiments, a self-focused IRAP required participants to respond to both positive and negative statements about themselves, whereas an other-focused IRAP required participants to respond to similar statements about others. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated perspective-taking with regard to an unspecified other. Experiments 3-6 investigated perspective-taking with regard to a specified other, with the specified relationship between self and other manipulated across experiments. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that the other-focused IRAP produced overall bias scores that were significantly stronger than responding to the self-focused IRAP. It is interesting that nonsignificant differences were recorded across Experiments 3-6 when other was specified. The findings obtained across the six studies highlight potentially important limitations in the use of the NL-IRAP as a measure of perspective-taking.

AB  - Background: Family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with increased dementia-risk. Objective: The Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) is a prospective longitudinal study of asymptomatic middle-aged offspring of AD patients (family history positive; FH+) and controls (whose parents have aged without dementia; FH-) aimed to unravel the contribution of midlife factors to future cognitive decline and dementia. Here we present the study design, methods, and baseline characteristics. Methods: Participants are members of the Maccabi Health Services, 40-65 years of age, with exquisitely detailed laboratory, medical diagnoses and medication data available in the Maccabi electronic medical records since 1998. Data collected through IRAP include genetic, sociodemographic, cognitive, brain imaging, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics at baseline and every three years thereafter. Results: Currently IRAP has 483 participants [mean age 54.95 (SD = 6.68) and 64.8% (n = 313) women], 379 (78.5%) FH+, and 104 (21.5%) FH-. Compared to FH-, FH+ participants were younger (p =0.011), more often males (p = 0.003) and with a higher prevalence of the APOE E4 allele carriers (32.9% FH+, 22% FH-; p = 0.040). Adjusting for age, sex, and education, FH+ performed worse than FH- in global cognition (p = 0.027) and episodic memory (p = 0.022). Conclusion: Lower cognitive scores and higher rates of the APOE E4 allele carriers among the FH+ group suggest that FH ascertainment is good. The combination of long-term historical health-related data available through Maccabi with the multifactorial information collected through IRAP will potentially enable development of dementia-prevention strategies already in midlife, a critical period in terms of risk factor exposure and initiation of AD-neuropathology.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Motivative augmentals are rules or statements that temporarily change the effectiveness of a consequence, similar to establishing operations for nonverbal consequences (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, & Roche, 2001). Many communications by an organization's leadership may function as such and alter the function of stimuli in the workplace, which in turn may influence employee behaviors (Houmanfar & Rodrigues, Journal of Applied Radical Behavior Analysis, N1, 22-27, 2012). There is a lack of experimental research regarding this, however, particularly under different organizational pay systems (i.e., financial contingencies), which have been repeatedly shown to influence performance (e.g., Gupta & Shaw, Compensation and Benefits Review, 30(2), 26-32, 1998; Locke, Feren, McCaleb, Shaw, & Denny, 1980). The current study sought to compare the two by measuring the effect of motivational statements on individual versus cooperative responding under two different pay-for-performance contingencies in an organizational analogue. Stimuli for the motivational statements were selected utilizing an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) with one group of participants, and these statements were then tested under piece-rate and profit-share conditions with a second group of participants in a counterbalanced reversal design. Results indicated that the financial contingencies had more of an effect on responding, but that motivational statements influenced behavior as well. In particular, motivational statements affected whether a participant chose to cooperate or behave individually more under financially neutral conditions (i.e., profit share) when there was no financial cost for doing so. As such, organizations can utilize memos or speeches to increase performance, but it is important for the content to align with financial contingencies in order to maximize performance.

AB  - A local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been postulated in the pineal gland. In addition to angiotensin II (Ang II), other active metabolites have been described. In this study, we aimed to investigate a role for Ang IV in melatonin synthesis and the presence of its proposed (IRAP)/AT(4) receptor (insulin-regulated aminopeptidase) in the pineal gland. The effect of Ang IV on melatonin synthesis was investigated in vitro using isolated pinealocytes. IRAP protein expression and activity were evaluated by Western blot and fluorimetry using Leu-4Me-beta-naphthylamide as a substrate. Melatonin was analyzed by HPLC, calcium content by confocal microscopy and cAMP by immunoassay. Ang IV significantly augmented the NE-induced melatonin synthesis to a similar degree as that achieved by Ang This Ang IV effect in pinealocytes appears to be mediated by an increase in the intracellular calcium content but not by cAMP. The (IRAP)/AT(4) expression and activity were identified in the pineal gland, which were significantly higher in membrane fractions than in soluble fractions. Ang IV significantly reduced IRAP activity in the pineal membrane fractions. The main findings of the present study are as follows: (1) Ang IV potentiates NE-stimulated melatonin production in pinealocytes, (2) the (TRAP)/AT(4) receptor is present in the rat pineal gland, and (3) Ang IV inhibits IRAP activity and increases pinealocytes [Ca2+](i). We conclude that Ang IV is an important component of RAS and modulates melatonin synthesis in the rat pineal gland.

T2  - BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL ISSUES
AB  - Gender stereotypes affect both women and men from childhood. Whereas men may be more often associated with STEM careers, women tend to be associated with nurturing and caring careers. The present research used an explicit scale and the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure to investigate how gender-career relational patterns could vary for Brazilian college students according to their gender and career. Both instruments included the names of careers stereotypically regarded as “male” or “female” and words indicating gender. Participants were divided into four groups (men and women in STEM and the humanities). A significant pm-male-STEM bias emerged for all groups, except the STEM-female group, the only group to show a significant pm-female-STEM bias (p < .05) and a significant difference from the other three groups. A significant implicit pro-men-male career bias was mostly more substantial among male students. In the explicit scales, participants tended to show a more neutral evaluation (not classifying careers as “male” or “female”). Correlations were found between explicit evaluations for male careers and the implicit trial type “women-male careers,” indicating that the more a career was explicitly evaluated as male, the more easily it was related with “women” as false at the implicit level.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This paper puts forward a rounder conceptual model for interpreting short- and long-term effects of choice behavior. As a further development of dual-process theory, Kahneman (2003) distinguished between intuition and reasoning, which served as the respective precursors of the cognitive processing systems 1 and 2. We maintain that they reflect the more rigorous distinction between brief and immediate and extended and elaborated relational responding, which may be reinterpreted through an analysis of their functional properties. Repertoires of relational responding are offered by the multi-dimensional multi-level model. Specifically, we provide a conceptual account of how nudging, or the manipulation of environmental contingencies, works on the creation and modification of relational framing. Educative nudges, or boosts, are a subset of nudges that may more easily maintain target choice behavior in the future. The central role of verbal behavior is essential toward formulating rules, which inform and guide choice behavior over time. Although nudges are traditionally regarded as System 1-steered aspects, they are herein regarded as cues for responding to relational frames, which may induce System 2-steered aspects. We suggest adopting the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) to inform how coherent and immediate responding to novel relational responding may occur in the presence of choice behavior. Several examples are included to support the claim of encompassing relational responding and choice behavior. We address the instances of consumer behavior, stereotypy and prejudices, eating behavior, and overcoming cognitive biases. The conclusions depict a promising way forward for the study of choice: an improved model for interpreting and overcoming human errors, due to changes in the contingencies of behavior.

AB  - Recent developments in relational frame theory (RFT) have outlined a number of key variables of potential importance when analyzing the dynamics involved in derived relational responding. Recent research has begun to explore the impact of a number of these variables on persistent rule-following, namely, levels of derivation and coherence. However, no research to date has systematically examined the impact of coherence on persistent rule-following at varying levels of derivation. Across two experiments, the impact of coherence (manipulated through the systematic use of performance feedback) was explored on persistent rule-following when derivation was relatively low (Exp. 1) and high (Exp. 2). A training protocol based on the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) was used to establish novel combinatorially entailed relations that manipulated the feedback provided on the untrained, derived relations (A-C) for five blocks of trials in Experiment1and one block of trials in Experiment2. One of these relations was then inserted into the rule for responding on a subsequent contingency-switching match-to-sample task to assess rule persistence. While no significant differences were found in Experiment1, the provision or non-provision of feedback had a significant differential impact on rule persistence in Experiment2. These differences, and the subtle complexities that appear to be involved in persistent rule-following in the face of reversed reinforcement contingencies, are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Stigmatizing attitudes about individuals with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) are known to contribute to the individual's psychological problems and response to treatment. Providers of SUD treatment services have been shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures. However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD treatment and therapist training.

AB  - Rule-governed behavior and derived relational responding have both been identified as important variables in human learning. Recent developments in the relational frame theory (RFT) have outlined a number of key variables of potential importance when analyzing the dynamics involved in derived relational responding. Recent research has explored the impact of one of these variables, level of derivation, on persistent rule-following and implicated another, coherence, as possibly important. However, no research to date has examined the impact of coherence on persistent rule-following directly. Across two experiments, coherence was manipulated through the systematic use of performance feedback, and its impact was examined on persistent rule-following. A training procedure based on the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP) was used to establish novel combinatorially entailed relations that manipulated the feedback provided on the trained relations (A-B and B-C) in Experiment 1, and on the untrained, derived relations (A-C) in Experiment 2. One of these relations was then inserted into the rule for responding on a subsequent contingency-switching match-to-sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. While no significant differences were found in Experiment 1, the provision or non-provision of feedback had a significant differential impact on rule-persistence in Experiment 2. Specifically, participants in the Feedback group resurged back to the original rule for significantly more responses after demonstrating contingency-sensitive responding than did the No-Feedback group, after the contingency reversal. The results highlight the subtle complexities that appear to be involved in persistent rule-following in the face of reversed reinforcement contingencies.

AB  - According to dual-process models, implicit self-esteem (SE) is based on automatic self-associations that can be measured with indirect techniques based on an associative conception of implicit cognition (e.g., Implicit Association Test; IAT). However, alternative theoretical proposals (e.g., relational frame theory; RFT) propose that implicit SE might not be based on automatic self-associations, but on implicit propositional self-evaluations that can be captured only with nonassociative implicit measures (e.g., Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; IRAP). In the present study, both reliability and validity of a new propositional measure of implicit self-esteem (relational responding task; RRT) were assessed, and compared with the SE-IAT and with two self-report scales of self-esteem. In the first study, two alternative self-esteem RRTs (SE-RRT and RSE-RRT) were administered along with a SE-IAT and other scales, to assess reliability and validity issues. The results showed: 1) acceptable, though not optimal, reliability for both RRTs; 2) an adequate support for convergent validity, with significant correlations between implicit and explicit measures of SE; 3) the criterion validity was supported for the RSE-RRT (with significant correlations with all theoretically linked scales), although only partially supported for the SE-RRT (with a significant correlation only with depression; 4) RRTs were not significantly correlated with impression management and self-deception; and 5) incremental validity of implicit propositional SE on depression, controlling for automatic SE associations and explicit self-esteem. In a second study, it was experimentally demonstrated that SE-RRT showed levels of “fakeability” similar to a classical implicit self-esteem measure like the SE-IAT, and considerably lower than SE scales.

AB  - Ethyl2-acetylamino-7-hydroxy-4-pyridin-3-yl-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HFI-419), the benzopyran-based inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), has previously been shown to improve spatial working and recognition memory in rodents. However, the mechanism of its cognitive-enhancing effect remains unknown. There is a close correlation between dendritic spine density and learning in vivo and several studies suggest that increases in neuronal glucose uptake and/or alterations to the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may improve memory and increase dendritic spine density. We aimed to identify the potential mechanism by which HFI-419 enhances memory by utilizing rat primary cultures of hippocampal cells. Alterations to dendritic spine density were assessed in the presence of varying concentrations of HFI-419 at different stages of hippocampal cell development. In addition, glucose uptake and changes to spine density were assessed in the presence of indinavir, an inhibitor of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT(4)), or the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor CAS 204140-01-2. We confirmed that inhibition of IRAP activity with HFI-419 enhanced spatial working memory in rats, and determined that this enhancement may be driven by GLUT(4)-mediated changes to dendritic spine density. We observed that IRAP inhibition increased dendritic spine density prior to peak dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons, and that spine formation was inhibited when GLUT(4)-mediated glucose uptake was blocked. In addition, during the peak phase of dendritic spine growth, the effect of IRAP inhibition on enhancement of dendritic spine density resulted specifically in an increase in the proportion of mushroom/stubby-like spines, a morphology associated with memory and learning. Moreover, these spines were deemed to be functional based on their expression of the pre-synaptic markers vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and synapsin. Overall, or findings suggest that IRAP inhibitors may facilitate memory by increasing hippocampal dendritic spine density via a GLUT(4)-mediated mechanism.

AB  - Angiotensin N (ang IV) is known to improve learning and memory in animal models but the mechanism is unclear. We have previously demonstrated sex differences in the pro-cognitive effects of ang IV, and that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) abolishes these effects. This study aimed to explore a possible mechanism underlying the sex differences and the effects of PAE in male mice. Mouse breeding harems received 5% ethanol in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation in a two bottle schedule. The effects of ang IV were assessed in offspring at 4 months of age using the open field test, novel object recognition test and elevated plus maze. Aminopeptidase activity of brain insulin-regulated amino peptidase (IRAP), a putative target of ang IV, was determined. As seen in a previous similar study, ang IV administered immediately after the second training trial significantly improved novel object recognition 24 h later in male mice but not female. PAE abolished this pro cognitive effect in males. PAE also increased anxiety-like behaviour in male but not female offspring. Ang IV decreased the aminopeptidase activity of brain IRAP in control male, but not female, mice; PAE abolished this inhibitory effect. Ang IV improved memory consolidation in male but not female mice and PAE abolished this effect in the males. While the effects of PAE may be related to increased anxiety; ang IV decreased the aminopeptidase activity in male but not female mice and PAE abolished this inhibitory effect. The results therefore suggest that improvements in learning and memory induced by peripheral administration of ang IV correlate with a reduction of the enzyme activity of IRAP. This is the first demonstration that ang IV administered peripherally can induce long-term (24 h) changes in IRAP function which are probably not simple competitive inhibition and the first demonstration that PAE alters IRAP activity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and objectives: According to the Neurocognitive Framework for Regulation Expectation (NFRE), actual and ideal self-esteem are related to how individuals anticipate and respond to a stressful event. Based on this framework, we investigated whether in individuals with low ideal self-esteem (moderator), a positive relationship between actual self-esteem and reactive autonomic regulation would be mediated by the amount of anticipatory autonomic regulation. Methods: Forty-five healthy females prepared a speech (i.e., anticipation) and performed it in front of a camera (i. e., stressor). Actual and ideal self-esteem were measured with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. Anticipatory and reactive autonomic stress regulation were indexed by heart rate variability, and affective responses were assessed via self-report. Results: Results were in line with predictions based on the NFRE: when ideal self-esteem was low, higher actual self-esteem was associated with higher reactive autonomic regulation, and this association was mediated by higher anticipatory autonomic regulation. Limitations: Because only female undergraduates were recruited, replication within a more heterogeneous sample is necessary to further generalize these findings. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis, based on the NFRE, that actual and ideal self-esteem interact in predicting the relationship between anticipatory and reactive stress regulation, and are a step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying successful stress regulation.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - In many educational systems, ethnic minority students score lower in their academic achievement, and consequently, teachers develop low expectations regarding this student group. Relatedly, teachers' implicit attitudes, explicit expectations, and causal attributions also differ between ethnic minority and ethnic majority students-all in a disadvantageous way for ethnic minority students. However, what is not known so far, is how attitudes and causal attributions contribute together to teachers' judgments. In the current study, we explored how implicit attitudes and causal attributions contribute to preservice teachers' judgments of the low educational success of an ethnic minority student. Results showed that both implicit attitudes and causal attributions predicted language proficiency and intelligence judgments. Negative implicit attitudes, assessed with the IRAP, and internal stable causal attributions led to lower judgments of language proficiency, whereas lower judgments of intelligence were predicted by positive implicit attitudes and higher judgments of intelligence by external stable attributions. Substantial differences in the prediction of judgments could be found between the IRAP and BIAT as measures of implicit attitudes.

AB  - Our previous study verified a sex difference of anti-hyperalgesia in rats and anti-allodynia in mice induced by intrathecal oxytocin (OT). In the model of intraplantar carrageenan-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia, intrathecal OT injection induced a substantial anti-hyperalgesia in male rats even at a low dose (0.125 nmol). In contrast, female rats only responded to an extremely high dose (1.25 nmol). This sex difference concurs with a lower expression of OT receptors and higher expression of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP; OT degrading enzyme) in the spinal cords of female rats. In this study, we further determined the role of female hormones in this sex difference by using ovariectomized rats. Our results show that a low dose of intrathecal OT caused a significant anti-hyperalgesia effect in ovariectomized female rats, similar to that seen in male rats. Ovariectomy did not cause any change of paw edema except at the late stage of convalescence when compared with the sham-operated group. Ovariectomy-induced faster recovery from edema but did not affect the severity of hyperalgesia. Moreover, there was a similar amount of IRAP expression in ovariectomized and sham rats. When estradiol (E2) was given together with OT, OT-induced anti-hyperalgesia was abolished at the developmental stage of hyperalgesia in ovariectomized rats. These results show an inhibitory role of female hormones generated from ovaries (mainly estrogen) in the sex difference of anti-hyperalgesia induced by OT. This study suggests the feasibility of a novel OT-based remedy to treat hyperalgesia in men and in menopausal women no receiving hormonal supplements.

AB  - The factors that determine the content and valence of spontaneous thoughts have not yet been clarified. In this study, we focused on the effects of bodily states and depression and anxiety traits. Participants performed a past/future thinking task in which three-part sentences including temporal cues were presented in a sequential pattern, for example “in the near future/dreams/will come true”. We measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) to assess affective processing, and event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess temporal processing of thoughts that emerged when the temporal cue words were presented. The HEPs predicted thought valence irrespective of personality traits. Larger N400 ERPs were observed in response to past-oriented than to future oriented words in participants with higher levels of depression, whereas the opposite was the case in participants with higher social anxiety. Our data suggest that afferent signals modulate affective thought-orientations as triggers, and that individuals with depression and anxiety have sensitivity toward temporal information at the neural level.

AB  - Implicit cognitive processing is theorized to have a central role in many forms of psychopathology. In the current review, we focus on implicit associations, by which we mean evaluative representations in memory that are difficult to control and do not require conscious reflection to influence affect, cognition, or behavior. We consider definitional and measurement challenges before examining recent empirical evidence for these associations in anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, posttraumatic stress, depressive, and alcohol use disorders. This examination is framed by a brief review of the ways that prominent models of psychopathology represent biased implicit processing of disorder-relevant information. We consider to what extent models reflect more traditional automatic/implicit versus strategic/explicit dual-process perspectives or reflect more recent dynamical systems perspectives in which mental representations are iteratively reprocessed, evolving continuously. Finally, we consider the future research needed to better understand the interactive and temporal dynamics of implicit cognition in psychopathology.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR
AB  - The seminal text on relational frame theory (RFT) was published 20 years ago and purported to offer a single overarching behavior-analytic account of human language and cognition. In the years thereafter, an increasing number of empirical and conceptual articles, book chapters in edited volumes, and whole volumes devoted to the account emerged. In recent years, RFT has experienced a period of intense empirical and conceptual development, facilitated in part by a research grant awarded by the Flanders Science Foundation, under its Odysseus program. This research program aimed to advance and extend the RFT account beyond the rendition presented in the seminal Hayes et al. (2001) volume. The current article aims to provide an overview of this research program, the empirical work and concepts it gave rise to, and their implications for an RFT account of human symbolic language and cognition. Overall, therefore, the article provides an account of relatively recent developments in RFT that extend beyond the 2001 volume and thus will, we hope, inform future research and critiques of the theory going forward.

AB  - Studies suggest that fear-related responses might be acquired through the facial expressions of other individuals. The present study aimed to investigate the derived transfer of aversive functions in equivalence classes comprised of facial expressions of fear and happiness. A delayed matching-to-sample task established two equivalence classes between facial expressions of emotions and nonsense abstract stimuli: B1-A1(Fear)-C1-D1; B2-A2(Happiness)-C2-D2. After relational training (AB, AC, CD) and equivalence tests (BD, DB), the transfer of function from the faces to the D stimuli was evaluated by means of (1) a semantic differential, (2) an avoidance task, (3) US expectancy scale, and (4) valence scale. Results fromthe semantic differential indicated that D1 and D2 had negative and positive evaluations, respectively. Fear related measures indicated that D1 (equivalent to fear) evoked avoidance responses, was highly rated on US expectancy and was negatively valenced; in comparison, D2 (equivalent to happy) did not evoke either avoidance or US expectancy and was positively valenced. These findings indicate that the participation of fearful faces in equivalence classes leads to derived fear, including derived avoidance responses.

T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB  - The effects of rules on human behaviour have long been identified as important in the psychological literature. The increasing importance of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous research has suggested may differentially impact persistent rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development: mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly, however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results across both experiments and their implications for future research are discussed.

T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that the relatedness of stimuli within the Function Acquisition Speed Test (FAST) methodology is sensitive to the learning histories of participants. For example, this method is sensitive to differences in the amount of baseline training provided to establish stimulus equivalence relations using arbitrary stimuli (Cummins a al., 2018a). However, it has not yet been investigated whether the relatedness of stimuli within the FAST varies based on differential nodal distances between stimuli within stimulus classes. If so, the FAST could serve an important adjunct assessment procedure for researchers who wish not only to assess the formation of stimulus classes using traditional methods, such as matching-to-sample, but also the relative relatedness of stimuli within complex stimulus classes (i.e., nodal distance). The current study sought to investigate this possibility. Participants (n = 16) were trained in the formation of two 4-member equivalence classes consisting of arbitrary nonsense syllables. Following this, participants completed three FAST assessments, each of which probed for the relatedness of stimulus pairs of differing nodal distance. Group- and individuallevel analyses broadly demonstrated that relatedness varied as a function of nodal distances in pre-trained stimulus classes. However, results also highlighted some limitations of the FAST at the individual level.

T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON BEHAVIOR SCIENCE
AB  - This article describes how the study of derived stimulus relations has provided the basis for a behavior-analytic approach to the study of human language and cognition in purely functional-analytic terms, with a focus on basic rather than applied research. The article begins with a brief history of the early behavior-analytic approach to human language and cognition, focusing on Skinner's (1957) text Verbal Behavior, his subsequent introduction of the concept of instructional control (Skinner, 1966), and Sidman's (1994) seminal research on stimulus equivalence relations. The article then considers how the concept of derived stimulus relations, as conceptualized within relational frame theory (Hayes et al., 2001), allowed researchers to refine and extend the functional approach to language and cognition in multiple ways. Finally, the article considers some recent conceptual and empirical developments that highlight how the concept of derived stimulus relations continues to play a key role in the behavior-analytic study of human language and cognition, particularly implicit cognition. In general, the article aims to provide a particular perspective on how the study of derived stimulus relations has facilitated and enhanced the behavior analysis of human language and cognition, particularly over the past 25-30 years.

TI  - The Propositional Evaluation Paradigm: Indirect Assessment of Personal Beliefs and Attitudes
AU  - Mueller, Florian
AU  - Rothermund, Klaus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Identification of propositions as the core of attitudes and beliefs (De Houwer, 2014) has resulted in the development of implicit measures targeting personal evaluations of complex sentences (e.g., the IRAP or the RRT). Whereas their utility is uncontested, these paradigms are subject to limitations inherent in their block-based design, such as allowing assessment of only a single belief at a time. We introduce the Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP) for assessment of multiple propositional beliefs within a single experimental block. Two experiments provide first evidence for the PEP's validity. In Experiment 1, endorsement of racist beliefs measured with the PEP was related to criterion variables such as explicit racism assessed via questionnaire and indicators of behavioral tendencies. Experiment 2 indicates that the PEP's implicit racism scores may predict actual behavior over and above explicit, self-report measures. Finally, Experiment 3 tested the PEP's applicability in the domain of hiring discrimination. Whereas general PEP-based gender stereotypes were not related to hiring bias, results suggest a possible role of female stereotypes in hiring discrimination. In the context of these findings, we discuss both the potential and possible challenges in adopting the PEP to different beliefs. In sum, these initial findings suggest that the PEP may offer researchers a reliable and easily administrable option for the indirect assessment of propositional evaluations.

T2  - NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Tankyrase, a member of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, regulates various cellular pathways including wnt signaling, telomere maintenance and mitosis, has become a prime target for the development of cancer therapeutics. Inhibition of tankyrase, which leads to its increased cellular accumulation, reveal the role of tankyrase in the regulation of Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation and glucose homeostasis in peripheral insulin responsive tissues. While in adipocytes inhibition of tankyrase improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, its inhibition in skeletal muscle leads to development of insulin resistance. Evidently further studies are required to determine the broader perspective of tankyrase in other cellular systems in regulating insulin signaling and insulin resistance. Role of tankyrase in neuronal tissues/cells has not been tested. In the present study, we investigated the effect of tankyrase inhibition in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant Neuro2a cells. Here, we report that XAV939 treatment, a tankyrase inhibitor, improves insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive as well as in insulin-resistant neuronal cells via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - AKT Substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) mediated pathway without affecting the phosphorylation/activation of AKT. AMPK inhibition by Compound C repressed XAV939 treatment mediated increase in glucose uptake, confirming the role of tankyrase in glucose uptake via AMPK. We show for the first time that inhibition of tankyrase significantly improves glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity of insulin-resistant neuronal cells via AMPK-AS160 mediated pathway. Our study demonstrates new mechanistic insights of tankyrase mediated regulation of insulin sensitivity as well as glucose uptake in neuronal cells.

AU  - Leech, Aileen
AU  - Barnes-Holmes, Dermot
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD
AB  - Recent research suggests that fear and avoidance responding based on derived transformation of functions may be considered functionally independent. The current study examined the impact of a fear-related verbal-rehearsal task on performance on two implicit relational assessment procedures (IRAPs), actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT. The study was conducted over 3 separate days. Day 1 involved exposure to a series of questionnaires, the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and homework. Day 2 involved a second exposure to the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task and exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. The final day involved a second exposure to the IRAPs and BAT. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., control, accept, or reduce fear). Broadly similar findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by Leech et al. (2017). No significant differences between the conditions emerged on the self-report measures, IRAPs, or the BAT. However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were concentrated almost exclusively in the control and reduce-fear conditions rather than the accept-fear condition. The replication of results reported here provide further evidence of the functional independence of approach and avoidance responding. Furthermore, the differential pattern of correlations observed provide further evidence that the fear-related verbal-rehearsal task affected a behavior-behavior relation, which may be directly relevant to the concept of defusion in the ACT literature. In addition, the differential arbitrarily applicable relational responding effects (DAARRE) model offers an alternative explanation for the results reported.

AB  - First-degree family history is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of late-onset AD risk loci with cognitive functioning among 315 offspring of AD patients. Participants were cognitively normal Jewish individuals, aged 40-65 years, from the Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) study. Twenty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these loci and the APOE E4 allele were included in the final analyses, and a polygenic risk score was also calculated. Using linear regression (assuming an additive genetic model), we found a significant association only for SNP rs9473117, located near the CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) gene, with global cognition. Controlling for demographic variables (age, sex, years of education, and ancestry), the late onset AD risk allele C was associated with lower global cognitive functioning (p = 0.0005), and withstood correction for multiple testing. After adjusting for additional characteristics (APOE E4 status and then also for cardiovascular factors), the results remained essentially unchanged (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0005, respectively). In secondary analyses examining specific cognitive domains, rs9473117 was similarly associated with episodic memory (p = 0.005), language (p = 0.009), and working memory/ attention (p = 0.018) but not with executive functions (p = 0.27). Again, the results were similar after adjusting for APOE E4 status and cardiovascular factors. The polygenic risk score was not associated with global cognitive functioning or with any of the 4 domains. In conclusion, our findings suggest a contribution of the CD2AP locus to cognitive functioning in middle-aged individuals with a parental history of AD. Further validations, including in longitudinal studies, are required. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
