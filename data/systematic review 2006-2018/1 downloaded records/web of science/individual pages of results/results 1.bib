Abstract = {{Experiment 1 aimed to establish ``fearful{''} and ``pleasant{''}
   functions for arbitrary stimuli (geometric shapes) by relating those
   stimuli to pictures of spiders and pets using a training version of the
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (TRAP). The transformation of
   these functions for the arbitrary stimuli was assessed by exposing
   participants to a `traditional' version of the TRAP, the Fear-IRAP
   employed by Leech et al. (2016, 2017). A broadly similar pattern of
   response biases was recorded for the Fear-IRAP as had been observed in
   the previously published studies. Experiment 1 thus supported the
   assumed but untested assumption that the relational context provided by
   the IRAP may both serve to establish and reveal fear-related response
   biases in arbitrary stimuli. A second experiment attempted to replicate
   the effects observed in Experiment 1 but using pictures of `unfamiliar'
   Australian marsupials as arbitrary stimuli. The pattern of results
   obtained in Experiment 2 failed to replicate the pattern observed in
   Experiment 1, or that reported in the previously published studies by
   Leech et al. Overall, the findings suggest a possibly important boundary
   condition for the IRAP as a training and/or testing context for
   establishing fear-related response biases for arbitrary stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of rules on human behaviour have long been identified as
   important in the psychological literature. The increasing importance of
   the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR),
   with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within
   Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous
   research has suggested may differentially impact persistent
   rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to
   date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two
   experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on
   persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development:
   mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A
   Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational
   network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in
   Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of
   derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample
   (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments
   were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of
   derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly,
   however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence
   was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results
   across both experiments and their implications for future research are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Research on self-determination theory has typically relied on explicit
   measures when examining the concept of competence need satisfaction. As
   a result, we know relatively little about competence need satisfaction

   developed and validated implicit measures of competence need
   satisfaction by drawing on two tasks: a relational variant of the
   implicit association test (IAT; Study 1, 3, and 4) and the implicit
   relational assessment procedure (IRAP; Study 2-3). Results across these
   studies revealed that both implicit measures were either unrelated or
   moderately related to their explicit counterpart. They were also
   unrelated to one another. Unlike the IRAP, the IAT was found to be
   reliable, to display discriminant validity, and to yield meaningful but
   modest relations with constructs in a nomological network. Together,
   these results provide modest support for the usefulness of the
   competence need satisfaction IAT but not of the competence need
   satisfaction IRAP as an implicit measure of the need for competence.
   Future research examining the unique predictive value of this IAT is

Abstract = {{This article describes how the study of derived stimulus relations has
   provided the basis for a behavior-analytic approach to the study of
   human language and cognition in purely functional-analytic terms, with a
   focus on basic rather than applied research. The article begins with a
   brief history of the early behavior-analytic approach to human language
   and cognition, focusing on Skinner's (1957) text Verbal Behavior, his
   subsequent introduction of the concept of instructional control
   (Skinner, 1966), and Sidman's (1994) seminal research on stimulus
   equivalence relations. The article then considers how the concept of
   derived stimulus relations, as conceptualized within relational frame
   theory (Hayes et al., 2001), allowed researchers to refine and extend
   the functional approach to language and cognition in multiple ways.
   Finally, the article considers some recent conceptual and empirical
   developments that highlight how the concept of derived stimulus
   relations continues to play a key role in the behavior-analytic study of
   human language and cognition, particularly implicit cognition. In
   general, the article aims to provide a particular perspective on how the
   study of derived stimulus relations has facilitated and enhanced the

Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Under the rubric of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), researchers have
   investigated the role of deictic relational responding in the analysis
   of self in relation to others, place, and time, primarily through the
   use of an extended developmental protocol (Barnes-Holmes, 2001). In a
   move toward extending methodologies for studying deictic relational
   responding, more recent research has employed the Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to measure deictic relational responding
   regarding I versus OTHER (Barbero-Rubio et al. in The Psychological
   Record, 66, 243-252, 2016). The initial purpose of the current study was
   to systematically replicate and extend this research. This extension
   involved the inclusion of a control condition in which no responding to
   self was involved, only responding to others. The results from
   Experiment 1 yielded significant IRAP effects for two of the four
   trial-types in both the deictic and control IRAPs. A second experiment
   involved a novel method for collecting IRAP data (a read-aloud
   procedure), which had been shown to yield significant effects for all
   four trial-types, and four significant effects were indeed recorded for
   both deictic and control IRAPs. Based on the current findings, a model
   is presented that seeks to explain the differential trial-type effects
   that are observed across the different IRAPs and the impact of the
   read-aloud procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Stigmatizing attitudes about individuals with a Substance Use Disorder
   (SUD) are known to contribute to the individual's psychological problems

   shown to endorse stigmatizing attitudes, explicitly and implicitly, and
   these attitudes can interfere with treatment. Most research on SUD
   stigma has used explicit measures, although a small body of implicit
   attitude research has demonstrated promise in using implicit measures.
   However, very little implicit measure data is available from populations
   of SUD treatment providers, and the ability of implicit measures to
   predict clinically relevant behaviors is a critical and relatively
   underexamined issue. The purpose of the current study was to examine
   implicit SUD stigma among treatment providers and to evaluate the impact
   of implicit stigma on measures of social distance and willingness to
   write letters of support for a client with a SUD. The results showed
   that an explicit measure of SUD stigma outperformed the implicit measure
   in predicting social distance, and that the implicit measure
   outperformed the explicit measure in predicting willingness to write
   letters of support. These data support the contention that implicit
   attitudes may have a practical and negative impact on treatment of
   individuals with a SUD. Future studies may focus on further developing
   implicit assessment of SUD stigma in the service of improving SUD
   treatment and therapist training.}},

Abstract = {{The research investigated the contextual effects of mood on implicit

   induction procedure; an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)
   examining biases towards wanting more or less; and questionnaires
   assessing life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale; SWLS),
   materialism (Material Values Scale; MVS), and positive and negative
   affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; PANAS). On the IRAP,
   shorter mean response latencies across consistent (more-good/less-bad)
   compared to inconsistent (more-bad/less-good) trial-blocks were
   interpreted as an implicit bias towards `wanting more'. Compared to the
   neutral mood condition, participants in the positive mood condition
   demonstrated an increased bias towards `wanting less' (p = .028).
   Several predicted associations were also observed. Measures of negative
   affect and reduced life satisfaction were significantly associated with
   an implicit bias towards `wanting more' (r(s)'s ranging from - .455 to

   wanting less (r(s) = .579, p = .006). The findings provide preliminary

Abstract = {{The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used as a
   measure of implicit cognition and has been used to analyze the dynamics
   of arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The current study uses
   the IRAP for the latter purpose. Specifically, the current research
   focuses on a pattern of responding observed in a previously published
   IRAP study that was difficult to explain using existing conceptual
   analyses. The pattern is referred to as the single-trial-type dominance
   effect because one of the IRAP trial types produces an effect that is
   significantly larger than that of the other three. Based on a post hoc
   explanation provided in a previously published article, the first
   experiment in the current series explored the impact of prior
   experimental experience on the single-trial-type dominance effect. The
   results indicated that the effect was larger for participants who
   reported high levels of experimental experience (M = 32.3 previous
   experiments) versus those who did not (M = 2.5 previous experiments). In
   the second experiment, participants were required to read out loud the
   stimuli presented on each trial and the response option they chose. The
   effect of experimental experience was absent, but the single-trial-type
   dominance effect remained. In the third experiment, a different set of
   stimuli than those used in the first two experiments was used in the
   IRAP, and a significant single-trial-type dominance effect was no longer
   observed. The results obtained from the three experiments led
   inductively to the development of a new model of the variables involved
   in producing IRAP effects-the differential arbitrarily applicable
   relational responding effects (DAARRE) model-which is presented in the

Abstract = {{The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has been used to

   measure referred to as the Probabilistic Index (Thas, De Neve, Clement,

   how the PI is more robust to the influence of outliers and skew (which

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{138-146}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that a crucial link between cognitive (i.e.,
   self-schemas) and biological vulnerability is prefrontal control. This
   is because decreased control leads to impaired ability to inhibit
   ruminative thinking after the activation of negative self-schemas.
   However, current evidence is mainly correlational. In the current
   experimental study we tested whether the effect of neurostimulation of
   the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on self-esteem is mediated by
   momentary ruminative self-referential thinking (MRST) after the
   induction of negative self-schemas by criticism. We used a single,
   sham-controlled crossover session of anodal transcranial Direct Current
   Stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC (cathode over the right
   supraorbital region) in healthy female individuals. After receiving
   tDCS/sham stimulation, we measured MRST and exposed the participants to
   critical audio scripts, followed by another MRST measurement.
   Subsequently, all participants completed two Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedures to implicitly measure actual and ideal
   self-esteem. Our behavioral data indicated a significant decrease in
   MRST after real but not sham tDCS. Moreover, although there was no
   immediate effect of tDCS on implicit self-esteem, an indirect effect was
   found through double mediation, with the difference in MRST from
   baseline to after stimulation and from baseline to after criticism as
   our two mediators. The larger the decrease of criticism induced MRST
   after real tDCS, the higher the level of actual self-esteem. Our results
   show that tDCS can influence cognitive processes such as rumination, and
   subsequently self-esteem, but only after the activation of negative
   self-schemas. Rumination and negative self-esteem characterize different
   forms of psychopathology, and these data expand our knowledge of the
   role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling these self-referential
   processes, and the mechanisms of action of tDCS.}},

Abstract = {{LVV-hemorphin-7 (LW-h7) is bioactive peptide resulting from degradation
   of hemoglobin beta-globin chain. LVV-7 is a specific agonist of
   angiotensin IV receptor. This receptor belongs to the class of
   insulin-regulated aminopeptidases (IMP), which displays oxytocinase
   activity. Herein, our aims were to assess whether: i) LVV-h7 modifies
   centrally organized behavior and cardiovascular responses to stress and
   ii) mechanisms underlying LVV-h7 effects involve activation of oxytocin
   (OT) receptors, probably as result of reduction of IRAP proteolytic
   activity upon OT. Adult male Wistar rats (270-370 g) received (i.p.)
   injections of LVV-h7 (153 nmol/kg), or vehicle (0.1 ml). Different
   protocols were used: i) open field (OP) test for locomotor/exploratory
   activities; ii) Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) for anxiety-like behavior; iii)
   forced swimming test (FST) test for depression-like behavior and iv) air
   jet for cardiovascular reactivity to acute stress exposure. Diazepam (2
   mg/kg) and imipramine (15 mg/kg) were used as positive control for EPM
   and FST, respectively. The antagonist of OT receptors (OTr), atosiban (1
   and 0,1 mg/kg), was used to determine the involvement of oxytocinergic
   paths. We found that LVV-h7: i) increased the number of entries and the
   time spent in open arms of the maze, an indicative of anxiolysis; ii)
   provoked antidepressant effect in the FS test; and iii) increased the
   exploration and locomotion; iv) did not change the cardiovascular
   reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to acute stress. Also, increases
   in locomotion and the antidepressant effects evoked by LVV-h7 were
   reverted by OTr antagonist. We conclude that LVV-h7 modulates behavior,
   displays antidepressant and anxiolytic effects that are mediated in part
   by oxytocin receptors.}},

   Scales showed an acceptance of mainstream sexual terms and unfavorable

   responses generally reflected favorable attitudes toward people who
   practice BDSM. IRAP scores were positively correlated with differences
   in smiling across the two interview conditions; that is, participants

Abstract = {{The current research aimed to examine the implicit biases of smokers and
   nonsmokers to others who did or did not smoke. Study 1 presented adult
   smokers and nonsmokers with an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) that assessed bias toward or against smokers and nonsmokers.
   Study 2 replicated this with adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Both
   studies also presented self-report measures. Both adult and adolescent
   smokers produced IRAP effects that indicated prosmoker biases;
   nonsmokers' biases were relatively neutral. Trends in the data from
   Studies 1 and 2 led to a post hoc analysis of the nonsmoker data to
   investigate the potential impact of parental smoking status on
   nonsmokers' biases. Both the IRAP and self-report measures data
   suggested that parental smoking status increased positivity in attitudes
   toward smokers among nonsmokers. Hierarchical logistic regression
   analyses indicated that the IRAP data in Study 1, but not Study 2,
   predicted smoking status above and beyond the self-report measures. The
   post hoc analyses showed a similar trend. The consistency of the
   findings with the only existing IRAP study of attitudes toward smokers,
   as well as with the broader literature, supports the view that response
   biases toward smokers may not change fundamentally from adolescence to
   adulthood, and that parental smoking status may having a moderating
   influence on these biases.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined racial bias among White individuals residing

   The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{62-69}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The relationship between self-esteem and
   paranoia may be influenced by social stress. This study aimed to
   replicate previous research on the impact ofsocial exclusion on paranoia
   and self-esteem in a non-clinical sample and to extend this work by
   examining the effect of exclusion on self-esteem at the `implicit'
   level.
   Methods: Non-clinical participants (N = 85) were randomly allocated to
   the Inclusion or Exclusion condition of a virtual ball-toss game
   ('Cyberball'). They completed self-reportmeasures of state paranoia and
   self-esteem, and two implicit measures of self-esteem - theImplicit
   Association Task (IAT) and Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) -prior to and after exposure to Cyberball.
   Results: Social exclusion increased state paranoia. This effect was
   moderated by distress associated with trait paranoia. Exclusion was also
   associated with decreased self-reported self-esteem, as well as reduced
   implicit self-esteem on the IAT. Changes in self-reported self-esteem
   were associated with state paranoia at post-Cyberball. The IRAP
   indicated that reductions in implicit self-esteem may be due to
   increases in `Me-Negative' and `Others-Positive' biases (rather than
   reductions in `Me-Positive' bias).
   Limitations: The current study involved a non-clinical sample and so
   findings cannot be generalized to clinical paranoia.
   Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous evidence that
   paranoia is associated with negative self-evaluations, whereas positive
   self-evaluations can persist in paranoia. They also provide support for
   the suggestion that investigations of self-esteem in paranoia should
   extend beyond global self-esteem and might benefit from a distinction
   between positive and negative components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   currently consists of four dimensions, (i) coherence, (ii) complexity,

   development, (i) mutual entailing, (ii) relational framing, (iii)
   relational networking, (iv) relating relations, and (v) relating

   improvement was specifically driven by improved implicit attitudes

Abstract = {{The current study examined the impact of a brief verbal rehearsal task
   on performance on two Implicit Relational Assessment Procedures (IRAPs),
   actual approach behavior towards a live spider (a behavioral approach
   task; BAT), and the relationship between the IRAPs and the BAT.
   Participants first completed the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ)
   followed by one of two verbal rehearsal tasks, one of which focused on
   fear acceptance and the other on fear reduction as ways of coping with
   fear. All participants then completed two IRAPs similar to those
   employed by Leech, Barnes- Holmes, and Madden (The Psychological Record,
   66(3), doi: 10.1007/s40732-016-0176-1, 2016). Finally, participants
   completed the BAT using a live common house spider. Broadly similar
   findings were obtained for performance on the IRAPs as were reported by
   Leech et al. No significant differences between the two verbal-rehearsal
   conditions emerged on the self-report measures, the IRAPs, or the BAT.
   However, correlations between performances on the IRAPs and the BAT were
   concentrated in the reduce-fear condition. When considered in the

   differential pattern of correlations observed in the current study
   suggest that the verbal rehearsal task impacted upon a behavior-behavior

Abstract = {{The vasopressin- and oxytocin-degrading enzyme insulin-regulated
   aminopeptidase (IRAP) is expressed in various organs including the
   brain. However, knowledge about its presence in human hypothalamus is
   fragmentary. Functionally, for a number of reasons (genetic linkage,
   hydrolysis of oxytocin and vasopressin, its role as angiotensin IV
   receptor in learning and memory and others) IRAP might play a role in
   schizophrenia. We studied the regional and cellular localization of IRAP
   in normal human brain with special emphasis on the hypothalamus and
   determined numerical densities of IRAP-expressing cells in the
   paraventricular, supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei in schizophrenia
   patients and controls. By using immunohistochemistry and Western blot
   analysis, IRAP was immunolocalized in postmortem human brains. Cell
   countings were performed to estimate numbers and numerical densities of
   IRAP immunoreactive hypothalamic neurons in schizophrenia patients and
   control cases. Shape, size and regional distribution of IRAP-expressing
   cells, as well the lack of co-localization with the glia marker
   glutamine synthetase, show that IRAP is expressed in neurons. IRAP
   immunoreactive cells were observed in the hippocampal formation,
   cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdala and, abundantly, hypothalamus.
   Double labeling experiments (IRAP and oxytocin/neurophysin 1, IRAP with
   vasopressin/neurophysin 2) revealed that IRAP is present in
   oxytocinergic and in vasopressinergic neurons. In schizophrenia
   patients, the numerical density of IRAP-expressing neurons in the
   paraventricular and the suprachiasmatic nuclei is significantly reduced,
   which might be associated with the reduction in neurophysin-containing
   neurons in these nuclei in schizophrenia. The pathophysiological role of
   lowered hypothalamic IRAP expression in schizophrenia remains to be
   established.}},

   students (26 female; M-age = 23.84) completed two IRAPs assessing the
   coordination of certain traits exclusively with women and others
   exclusively with men. Effects found on the IRAP were in the expected

   women but not men with other traits). In addition, the traits ascribed
   to men within the IRAP were evaluated as more hirable by a large
   majority of participants (83\%) on an explicit preference task. The

   studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit
   male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with
   the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and
   non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture
   of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit
   pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a
   pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A
   number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and
   the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for
   the development of interventions. If this relational response can become

   improves memory in both normal rodents and in models of memory deficit.
   However, in contrast, the global IRAP knockout mice (KO) demonstrate
   age-accelerated spatial memory deficits and no improvements in
   performance in any memory tasks. Potentially, the observed memory
   deficit could be due to the absence of IRAP in the developing brain. We
   therefore generated a postnatal forebrain neuron-specific IRAP knockout
   mouse line (CamKIIalphaCre; IRAPIox/Iox). Unexpectedly, we demonstrated
   that postnatal deletion of IRAP in the brain results in significant
   deficits in both spatial reference and object recognition memory at
   three months of age, although spatial working memory remained intact.
   These results indicate a significant role for IRAP in postnatal brain
   development and normal function of the hippocampus in adulthood. (C)

Abstract = {{The current research used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP) as a preliminary step toward bringing a broad, functional
   approach to understanding psychosis, by focusing on the specific
   phenomenon of auditory hallucinations of voices and sounds (often
   referred to as hearing voices). On this path, we created a taxonomy of
   some critical features of voice hearing based on the existing literature
   (i.e., perceived normality of voices, appraisals of self and other
   people hearing voices, and fear of voices) as a focus of our
   experimental manipulations. It was our hope that our findings would add
   to the broad literature that has used explicit measures to study these
   phenomena, and that the use of an `implicit' measure might assist toward
   a functional analytic understanding. Three pilot studies were conducted
   to assess the relations within which hearing voices participates in
   non-clinical voice hearers (i.e., individuals who hear voices but have
   no clinical diagnosis or distress) and compared to non-voice hearing
   control participants. The IRAP effects demonstrated both positive and
   negative relational responses across the three studies, and these
   effects varied according to explicit levels of delusional ideation.
   Furthermore, these IRAP effects also predicted explicit aspects of voice
   hearing and well-being. The current set of pilot studies demonstrate the
   utility and precision of the IRAP in this domain, and we propose that
   this type of experimental analysis may hold potential for future
   bottom-up functional analyses of voice hearing.}},

Abstract = {{The zinc metallopeptidase insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which
   is highly expressed in the hippocampus and other brain regions
   associated with cognitive function, has been identified as a
   high-affinity binding site of the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV).
   This hexapeptide is thought to facilitate learning and memory by binding
   to the catalytic site of IRAP to inhibit its enzymatic activity. In
   support of this hypothesis, low molecular weight, nonpeptide specific
   inhibitors of TRAP have been shown to enhance memory in rodent models.
   Recently, it was demonstrated that linear and macrocyclic Ang IV-derived
   peptides can alter the shape and increase the number of dendritic spines
   in hippocampal cultures, properties associated with enhanced cognitive
   performance. After screening a library of 10 500 drug like substances
   for their ability to inhibit IRAP, we identified a series of low
   molecular weight aryl sulfonamides, which exhibit no structural
   similarity to Ang IV, as moderately potent IRAP inhibitors:A structural
   and biological characterization of three of these aryl sulfonamides was
   performed. Their binding modes to human IRAP were explored by docking
   calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations and binding
   affinity estimations using the linear interaction energy method. Two
   alternative binding modes emerged from this analysis, both of which
   correctly rank the ligands according to their experimental binding
   affinities for this series of compounds. Finally, we show that two of
   these drug-like IRAP inhibitors can alter dendritic spine morphology and
   increase spine density in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The current study examined the impact of varying pictorial
   cues and testing contexts on implicit alcohol-related expectancies.
   Method: Seventy-six participants were assigned randomly to complete an
   Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in either a pub or
   lecture context. The TRAP exposed participants to pictorial cues that
   depicted an alcoholic beverage in the foreground of a pub
   (alcohol-congruent stimuli) or university lecture theater (alcohol
   incongruent stimuli), and participants were required to match both
   positive and negative alcohol-related outcome expectancies to these
   stimuli. Corresponding to a 4 x 2 design, TRAP trial types were included
   in the analysis as repeated-measure variables, whereas testing
   environment was input as a between-participants variable. Results:
   Participants more readily endorsed that drinking alcohol was related to
   positive expectancies when responding to alcohol-congruent stimuli, and
   this was strengthened when participants completed the task in a pub.
   Moreover, they more readily confirmed that alcohol was related to
   negative expectancies when responding to alcohol-incongruent stimuli.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that alcohol-related cues and
   environmental contexts may be a significant driver of positive
   alcohol-related cognitions, which may have implications for the design
   of interventions. They emphasize further the importance of examining
   implicit cognitions in ecologically valid testing contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Experiential avoidance (EA) is a generalized risk factor for
   psychopathology and is defined as an unwillingness to remain in contact

   to date have involved relatively small samples, limited consideration of

   conceptually narrow aspect of EA. The current study describes the
   initial piloting of an IRAP designed to assess implicit repertoires
   regarding EA and acceptance in response to anxiety-relevant and positive
   emotional words. A variety of conceptually relevant self-report measures
   were administered along with the EA IRAP to a sample of college
   undergraduates. Dependent variables included average latencies for each
   block type as well as D-scores for each trial type of the IRAP. Evidence
   for convergent validity was revealed by correlations between the IRAP
   block-type latencies and a self-report measure of defusion, while
   unexpected divergent relations were obtained between self-reports and
   IRAP D-scores. Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust

Abstract = {{The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is increasingly used
   in applied and clinical settings, and yet many of the procedural
   variables of the measure have not been subjected to a systematic
   analysis. One such variable is the type of rules that are employed when
   instructing the IRAP and the effect this might have on participants'
   performances. In the current article, three experiments were used to
   assess the impact of three different types of rules or instructions on
   IRAP performance. The instructions varied in the degree to which they
   specified parts of the relational network being assessed by the IRAP.
   The findings showed that the type of rule presented to participants
   during an IRAP can have a dramatic effect on the strength and direction
   of the trial-type effects that are produced by the measure. Furthermore,
   the type of instructions employed appear to interact with the order in
   which the IRAP blocks are presented (history-consistent versus
   history-inconsistent). The findings indicate that the behavioural
   dynamics that occur when participants complete an IRAP require extensive

Title = {{Individuals with current suicidal ideation demonstrate implicit
   ``fearlessness of death{''}}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Suicidal behaviour has proved to be difficult
   to predict, due in part to the particular limitations of introspection
   within suicidality. In an effort to overcome this, recent research has
   demonstrated the utility of indirect measures of ``implicit{''}
   attitudes within the study of suicidality. However, research to date has
   focused predominantly on implicit self-evaluations and self-death
   associations. No work has examined implicit evaluations of death,
   despite the theoretical importance of such evaluations; ``fearlessness
   of death{''} is central to both the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and
   the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicide.
   Methods: Twenty-three psychiatric patients with current suicidal
   ideation and twenty-five normative university students completed two
   versions of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) that
   targeted evaluations of death. One task specified personal death (i.e.,
   was self-focused) and the other targeted death in the abstract.
   Results: Self-focused evaluations of death reliably distinguished
   between the two groups, correctly classifying 74\% of cases, but
   evaluations of death in the abstract did not. The suicidal group
   produced specific biases indicating a rejection of the negativity of
   death. Results are consistent with the definition of suicidality as
   involving a self-focused wish to die..
   Limitations: For ethical reason, suicidal behaviours were not assessed
   in the normative group. Groups were therefore not mutually exclusive.
   This may have decreased the specificity of the IRAP.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is associated with an implicit
   ``fearlessness of death{''}. The utility of implicit death-evaluations
   should therefore be considered alongside self-evaluations and self-death
   associations in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Obesity, food restriction, and implicit attitudes to healthy and
   unhealthy foods: Lessons learned from the implicit relational assessment
   procedure}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{41-54}},

Abstract = {{It has been argued that obese individuals evaluate high caloric,
   palatable foods more positively than their normal weight peers, and that
   this positivity bias causes them to consume such foods, even when
   healthy alternatives are available. Yet when self-reported and automatic
   food preferences are assessed no such evaluative biases tend to emerge.
   We argue that situational (food deprivation) and methodological factors
   may explain why implicit measures often fail to discriminate between the
   food-evaluations of these two groups. Across three studies we
   manipulated the food deprivation state of clinically obese and
   normal-weight participants and then exposed them to an indirect
   procedure (IRAP) and self-report questionnaires. We found that automatic
   food-related cognition was moderated by a person's weight status and
   food deprivation state. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic and
   predictive value of implicit measures may be increased when (a)
   situational moderators are taken into consideration and (b) we pay
   greater attention to the different ways in which people automatically
   relate rather than simply categorize food stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Measuring Implicit Sexual Response Biases to Nude Male and Female
   Pictures in Androphilic and Gynephilic Men}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{829-841}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Snowden, Wichter, and Gray (2008) demonstrated that an Implicit
   Association Test and a Priming Task both predicted the sexual
   orientation of gynephilic and androphilic men in terms of their
   attraction biases towards pictures of nude males and females. For both
   measures, relative bias scores were obtained, with no information on the
   separate response biases to each target gender. The present study sought
   to extend this research by assessing both relative and individual
   implicit biases using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure
   (IRAP). An explicit measure screened for men with androphilic (n = 16)
   or gynephilic (n = 16) orientations on the dimensions of ``sexual
   attraction,{''} ``sexual behavior,{''} ``sexual fantasies,{''}
   ``hetero/gay lifestyle,{''} and ``self identification.{''} The IRAP
   involved responding ``True{''} or ``False{''} to pictures of nude males
   and females as either attractive or unattractive. Participants were
   required to respond in a manner consistent with their reported sexual
   orientation for half of the IRAP's test blocks and inconsistent for the
   other half. Response latencies were recorded and analyzed. The IRAP
   revealed a non-orthogonal pattern of biases across the two groups and
   had an excellent ability to predict sexual orientation with areas under
   the curves of 1.0 for the relative bias score and .94 and .95 for the
   bias scores for the male and female pictures, respectively. Correlations
   between the IRAP and explicit measures of sexual orientation were
   consistently high. The findings support the IRAP as a potentially
   valuable tool in the study of sexual preferences.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORD}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Although multiple studies have demonstrated that the Implicit
   Association Test (IAT) can be successfully faked, a single study using
   the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP; McKenna,
   Barnes-Holmes, Barnes-Holmes, \& Stewart, International Journal of
   Psychology and Psychological Therapy, 7(2): 253-268, 2007) concluded
   that this behavior-analytic alternative to implicit measures may be
   relatively immune to faking. The current study examined the fakability
   of the IRAP using more accessible faking instructions and an idiographic
   approach to stimulus selection. The methodology also provided an
   opportunity to examine split-half and test-retest reliability, an
   underreported statistic among existing IRAP publications. Three IRAPs
   were delivered in succession to 102 undergraduates randomly assigned to
   one of three conditions: three real IRAPs, two real IRAPs followed by a
   faked IRAP, or one real IRAP followed by two faked IRAPs. Split-half
   reliabilities were acceptable for four of the six real IRAPs and
   excellent for the three faked IRAPs. For the group receiving three real
   IRAPs, consecutive IRAPs generated significant test-retest correlations;
   the group engaging in two consecutive faked IRAPs also generated a
   significant test-retest correlation. Furthermore, all groups that
   received faking instructions subsequently demonstrated significantly
   reversed IRAP performance compared to previous real IRAPs and to real
   IRAPs in other conditions: Faking was robustly demonstrated. These
   results may have implications with regard not only to the fakability but
   also the reliability of the measure. Future research might focus on
   methods of detecting and/or preventing faking of the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to test the effect of behavior therapy training
   on the assessment of self-forgiveness, focusing on the feelings or

   been developed across a series of previously published studies.
   Additionally, the research explored the extent to which responding on
   the IRAP correlated with standardized measures of psychopathology,
   including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based
   directly on the IRAP. Forty undergraduate and postgraduate students
   completed the study (20 individuals who were teaching on, attending, or
   who had attended a course in clinical behavior analysis and 20 students
   from different fields). The two groups (behavior therapists and
   nontherapists) completed the 2 IRAPs and the explicit measures. Overall,
   only 1 of the 2 IRAPs, the one that targeted feelings rather than
   outcomes, produced clear and significant differences between the
   behavior therapist and nontherapist groups. This result indicated that
   the diverging performances were specific to the stimuli that were
   presented in the IRAP rather than reflecting a generic between-group
   difference produced by the measure itself. Furthermore, both IRAPs
   predicted levels of self-reported psychopathology and self-compassion. A
   number of potential reasons why this pattern of results emerged using
   the 2 IRAPs and explicit measures with these 2 groups of participants

Abstract = {{How can implicit attitudes best be measured? The Implicit Relational
   Assessment Procedure (IRAP), unlike the Implicit Association Test (IAT),
   claims to measure absolute, not just relative, implicit attitudes. In
   the IRAP, participants make congruent (Fat Person-Active: false; Fat
   Person-Unhealthy: true) or incongruent (Fat Person-Active: true; Fat
   Person-Unhealthy: false) responses in different blocks of trials. IRAP
   experiments have reported positive or neutral implicit attitudes (e.g.,
   neutral attitudes toward fat people) in cases in which negative
   attitudes are normally found on explicit or other implicit measures. It
   was hypothesized that these results might reflect a positive framing
   bias (PFB) that occurs when participants complete the IRAP. Implicit
   attitudes toward categories with varying prior associations (nonwords,
   social systems, flowers and insects, thin and fat people) were measured.
   Three conditions (standard, positive framing, and negative framing) were
   used to measure whether framing influenced estimates of implicit
   attitudes. It was found that IRAP scores were influenced by how the task
   was framed to the participants, that the framing effect was modulated by
   the strength of prior stimulus associations, and that a default PFB led
   to an overestimation of positive implicit attitudes when measured by the
   IRAP. Overall, the findings question the validity of the IRAP as a tool
   for the measurement of absolute implicit attitudes. A new tool (Simple
   Implicit Procedure: SIP) for measuring absolute, not just relative,
   implicit attitudes is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of reinforcer-focused statements
   vetted by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) on the
   intensity of participation in an exercise class. Using a relative heart
   rate measure, the first experiment compared individually selected
   phrases focused on the positive consequences of exercise to general
   topographic advice about how to exercise using an alternating treatments
   design, and found that participants exercised harder in the presence of
   the reinforcer-focused phrases. Experiment 2 tested a similar comparison
   using phrases focused on consequences that were shown to be neutral or
   negative by the IRAP, and found no consistent effect on responding.
   These results support a key prediction from previous research in
   Relational Frame Theory, namely that reinforcer focused statements can
   function as motivative augmentals, and they suggest that such motivative
   effects can impact behaviours of applied importance such as exercise.
